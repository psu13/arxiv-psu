% "moretext" document style option.
% Jean-Francois Lamy, July 86
%
% Redefines the margins so that they are more in line with 
% what we are used to see.
%
% "a4" document style option.
% John Pavel, May 1987
%
% Redefines the \textheight and \topmargin for A4 paper, as opposed to US paper.

% \textwidth is not altered because A4 is narrower than US paper.
%
% \textheight is the height of text (including footnotes and figures, 
% excluding running head and foot).
%
% Adjusting \textheight will adjust position of the bottom of the page.
% Must preserve "(\textheight - \topskip) divides \baselineskip".
% \topskip always appears to be 10pt.
%
%
% Following Lamport's change to other style files on 24 Jun 86,
% changed to explicitly compute \textheight to avoid roundoff.  The
% value of the multiplier was calculated as the floor of the old
% \textheight minus \topskip, divided by \baselineskip for
% \normalsize.
