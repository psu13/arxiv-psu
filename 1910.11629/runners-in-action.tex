%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
Runners of algebraic effects, also known as comodels, provide a mathematical
model of resource management. We show that they also give rise to a programming
concept that models top-level external resources, as well as allows programmers
to modularly define their own intermediate ``virtual machines''.
We capture the core ideas of programming with runners in an equational calculus $\lambdacoop$, which we equip  
with a sound and coherent denotational semantics that guarantees the linear use of
resources and execution of finalisation code. We accompany $\lambdacoop$ with
examples of runners in action, provide a prototype language implementation in \pl{OCaml},
as well as a \pl{Haskell} library based on $\lambdacoop$.
