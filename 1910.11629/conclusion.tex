\section{Conclusion and future work}
\label{sect:conclusion}

We have shown that effectful runners form a mathematically natural
and modular model of resources, modelling not only the top level external resources,
but allowing programmers to also define their own intermediate ``virtual machines''.
Effectful runners give rise to a bona fide programming concept, an idea we have captured
in a small calculus, called $\lambdacoop$, which we have implemented both as a
language and a library. We have given $\lambdacoop$
an algebraically natural denotational semantics, and shown how to program
with runners through various examples.

We leave combining runners and general effect handlers for future work.
%
As runners are essentially affine handlers, inspired by \pl{Multicore OCaml}
we also plan to investigate efficient compilation for runners.
%
On the theoretical side, by developing semantics in a $\Sub(\Cpo)$-enriched
setting~\cite{Power:EnrichedLawvereTheories}, we plan to support recursion at
all levels, and remove the distinction between ground and arbitrary types.
Finally, by using proof-relevant subtyping~\cite{Saleh:ExplicitSybTyping} and
synthesis of lenses~\cite{Miltner:SynthesizingSymmLenses}, we plan to upgrade 
subtyping from a simple inclusion to relating types by lenses.
