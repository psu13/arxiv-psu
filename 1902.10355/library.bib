abstract = {We review the physical phenomena that arise when quantum mechanical energy levels are modulated in time. The dynamics resulting from changes in the transition frequency is a problem studied since the early days of quantum mechanics. It has been of constant interest both experimentally and theoretically since, with the simple two-state model providing an inexhaustible source of novel concepts. When the transition frequency of a quantum system is modulated, several phenomena can be observed, such as Landau–Zener–St{\"{u}}ckelberg–Majorana interference, motional averaging and narrowing, and the formation of dressed states with the appearance of sidebands in the spectrum. Adiabatic changes result in the accumulation of geometric phases, which can be used to create topological states. In recent years, an exquisite experimental control in the time domain was gained through the parameters entering the Hamiltonian, and high-fidelity readout schemes allowed the state of the system to be monitored non-destructively. These developments were made in the field of quantum devices, especially in superconducting qubits, as a well as in atomic physics, in particular in ultracold gases. As a result of these advances, it became possible to demonstrate many of the fundamental effects that arise in a quantum system when its transition frequencies are modulated. The purpose of this review is to present some of these developments, from two-state atoms and harmonic oscillators to multilevel and many-particle systems.},

@article{Vial2014,
abstract = {A quasimodal expansion method (QMEM) is developed to model and understand the scattering properties of arbitrary shaped two-dimensional (2-D) open structures. In contrast with the bounded case which have only discrete spectrum (real in the lossless media case), open resonators show a continuous spectrum composed of radiation modes and may also be characterized by resonances associated to complex eigenvalues (quasimodes). The use of a complex change of coordinates to build Perfectly Matched Layers (PMLs) allows the numerical computation of those quasimodes and of approximate radiation modes. Unfortunately, the transformed operator at stake is no longer self-adjoint, and classical modal expansion fails. To cope with this issue, we consider an adjoint eigenvalue problem which eigenvectors are bi-orthogonal to the eigenvectors of the initial problem. The scattered field is expanded on this complete set of modes leading to a reduced order model of the initial problem. The different contributions of the eigenmodes to the scattered field unambiguously appears through the modal coefficients, allowing us to analyze how a given mode is excited when changing incidence parameters. This gives new physical insights to the spectral properties of different open structures such as nanoparticles and diffraction gratings. Moreover, the QMEM proves to be extremely efficient for the computation of Local Density Of States (LDOS).},

abstract = {A complete analysis of the decoherence properties of a Josephson junction qubit is presented. The qubit is of the flux type and consists of two large loops forming a gradiometer, one small loop, and three Josephson junctions. We develop a complete, quantitative description of the inductances and capacitances of the circuit. Including two stray capacitances makes the quantum mechanical modeling of the system five dimensional. To make the required calculation tractable, we devise a general Born-Oppenheimer approximation which reduces the effective dimensionality in the calculation to one. Contributions to relaxation ( T 1 ) and dephasing ( T ϕ ) arising from two different control circuits, one coupled to the small loop and one coupled to a large loop, is computed. We explore T 1 and T ϕ along an optimal line in the space of applied fluxes; along this “S line” we see significant and rapidly varying contributions to the decoherence parameters, primarily from the circuit coupling to the large loop.},

abstract = {We present microwave-frequency NbTiN resonators on silicon, systematically achieving internal quality factors above 1 M in the quantum regime. We use two techniques to reduce losses associated with two-level systems: an additional substrate surface treatment prior to NbTiN deposition to optimize the metal-substrate interface and deep reactive-ion etching of the substrate to displace the substrate-vacuum interfaces away from high electric fields. The temperature and power dependence of resonator behavior indicate that two-level systems still contribute significantly to energy dissipation, suggesting that more interface optimization could further improve performance.},

@article{HoEom2012,
abstract = {Amplifiers are ubiquitous in electronics and play a fundamental role in a wide range of scientific measurements. From a user's perspective, an ideal amplifier has very low noise, operates over a broad frequency range, and has a high dynamic range - it is capable of handling strong signals with little distortion. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain all of these characteristics simultaneously. For example, modern transistor amplifiers offer multi-octave bandwidths and excellent dynamic range. However, their noise remains far above the fundamental limit set by the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Parametric amplifiers, which predate transistor amplifiers and are widely used in optics, exploit a nonlinear response to transfer power from a strong pump tone to a weak signal. If the nonlinearity is purely reactive, ie. nondissipative, in theory the amplifier noise can reach the quantum-mechanical limit. Indeed, microwave frequency superconducting Josephson parametric amplifiers do approach the quantum limit, but generally are narrow band and have very limited dynamic range. In this paper, we describe a superconducting parametric amplifier that overcomes these limitations. The amplifier is very simple, consisting only of a patterned metal film on a dielectric substrate, and relies on the nonlinear kinetic inductance of a superconducting transmission line. We measure gain extending over 2 GHz on either side of an 11.56 GHz pump tone, and we place an upper limit on the added noise of the amplifier of 3.4 photons at 9.4 GHz. Furthermore, the dynamic range is very large, comparable to microwave transistor amplifiers, and the concept can be applied throughout the microwave, millimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave bands.},

abstract = {We present a novel shadow evaporation technique for the realization of junctions and capacitors. The design by e-beam lithography of strongly asymmetric undercuts on a bilayer resist enables in situ fabrication of junctions and capacitors without the use of the well-known suspended bridge (Dolan 1977 Appl. Phys. Lett. 31 337-9). The absence of bridges increases the mechanical robustness of the resist mask as well as the accessible range of the junction size, from 10(-2) µm(2) to more than 10(4) µm(2). We have fabricated Al/AlO(x)/Al Josephson junctions, phase qubit and capacitors using a 100 kV e-beam writer. Although this high voltage enables a precise control of the undercut, implementation using a conventional 20 kV e-beam is also discussed. The phase qubit coherence times, extracted from spectroscopy resonance width, Rabi and Ramsey oscillation decays and energy relaxation measurements, are longer than the ones obtained in our previous samples realized by standard techniques. These results demonstrate the high quality of the junction obtained by this bridge-free technique.},

An average process fidelity of {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}F{\}}=93\backslash{\%}{\$} is estimated for three two-qubit gates via quantum process tomography. We establish the suitability of these techniques for computation by preparing a four-qubit maximally entangled state and comparing the estimated state fidelity against the expected performance of the individual entangling gates. In addition, we prepare an eight-qubit register in all possible bitstring permutations and monitor the fidelity of a two-qubit gate across one pair of these qubits. Across all such permutations, an average fidelity of {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}F{\}}=91.6\backslashpm2.6\backslash{\%}{\$} is observed.

abstract = {We report microwave transmission measurements of superconducting Fabry-Perot resonators, having a superconducting nanowire placed at a supercurrent antinode. As the plasma oscillation is excited, the supercurrent is forced to flow through the nanowire. The microwave transmission of the resonator-nanowire device shows a nonlinear resonance behavior, significantly dependent on the amplitude of the supercurrent oscillation. We show that such amplitude-dependent response is due to the nonlinearity of the current-phase relationship of the nanowire. The results are explained within a nonlinear oscillator model of the Duffing oscillator, in which the nanowire acts as a purely inductive element, in the limit of low temperatures and low amplitudes. The low-quality factor sample exhibits a “crater” at the resonance peak at higher driving power, which is due to dissipation. We observe a hysteretic bifurcation behavior of the transmission response to frequency sweep in a sample with a higher quality factor. The Duffing model is used to explain the Duffing bistability diagram. We also propose a concept of a nanowire-based qubit that relies on the current dependence of the kinetic inductance of a superconducting nanowire.},

abstract = {The large available Hilbert space and high coherence of cavity resonators makes these systems an interesting resource for storing encoded quantum bits. To perform a quantum gate on this encoded information, however, complex nonlinear operations must be applied to the many levels of the oscillator simultaneously. In this work, we introduce the Selective Number-dependent Arbitrary Phase (SNAP) gate, which imparts a different phase to each Fock state component using an off-resonantly coupled qubit. We show that the SNAP gate allows control over the quantum phases by correcting the unwanted phase evolution due to the Kerr effect. Furthermore, by combining the SNAP gate with oscillator displacements, we create a one-photon Fock state with high fidelity. Using just these two controls, one can construct arbitrary unitary operations, offering a scalable route to performing logical manipulations on oscillator-encoded qubits.},

abstract = {A continuously monitored quantum system prepared in an excited state will decay to its ground state with an abrupt jump. The jump occurs stochastically on a characteristic time scale T1, the lifetime of the excited state. These quantum jumps, originally envisioned by Bohr, have been observed in trapped atoms and ions, single molecules, photons, and single electrons in cyclotrons. Here we report the first observation of quantum jumps in a macroscopic quantum system, in our case a superconducting "artificial atom" or quantum bit (qubit) coupled to a superconducting microwave cavity. We use a fast, ultralow-noise parametric amplifier to amplify the microwave photons used to probe the qubit state, enabling continuous high-fidelity monitoring of the qubit. This technique represents a major step forward for solid state quantum information processing, potentially enabling quantum error correction and feedback, which are essential for building a quantum computer. Our technology can also be readily integrated into hybrid circuits involving molecular magnets, nitrogen vacancies in diamond, or semiconductor quantum dots.},

In particular, we show that the scattering with the V-type atom exhibits a destructive interference effect leading to two-photon coupled-resonator-induced transparency, where the nonlinear part of the two-photon scattering matrix vanishes when each incident photon fulfills a single-photon condition for transparency.},

The links connecting these nodes can be established using traveling photons that need to be absorbed at the receiving node with high efficiency. This is achievable by shaping the temporal profile of the photons and absorbing them at the receiver by time reversing the emission process. Here, we demonstrate a scheme for creating shaped microwave photons using a superconducting transmon-type three-level system coupled to a transmission line resonator. In a second-order process induced by a modulated microwave drive, we controllably transfer a single excitation from the third level of the transmon to the resonator and shape the emitted photon. We reconstruct the density matrices of the created single-photon states and show that the photons are antibunched. We also create multipeaked photons with a controlled amplitude and phase. In contrast to similar existing schemes, the one we present here is based solely on microwave drives, enabling operation with fixed frequency transmons.},

The supercurrent can be switched on/off by a gate voltage acting on the electron density in the nanowire. A variation in gate voltage induces universal fluctuations in the normal-state conductance, which are clearly correlated to critical current fluctuations.

@article{Malekakhlagh2017,
abstract = {We present a Heisenberg-Langevin formalism to study the effective dynamics of a superconducting qubit coupled to an open multimode resonator, without resorting to the rotating wave, two level, Born or Markov approximations. Our effective equations are derived by eliminating resonator degrees of freedom while encoding their effect in the Green's function of the electromagnetic background. We account for the openness of the resonator exactly by employing a spectral representation for the Green's function in terms of a set of non-Hermitian modes. A well-behaved time domain perturbation theory is derived to systematically account for the nonlinearity of weakly nonlinear qubits like transmon. We apply this method to the problem of spontaneous emission, capturing accurately the non-Markovian features of the qubit dynamics, valid for any qubit-resonator coupling strength. Any discrete-level quantum system coupled to the electromagnetic continuum is subject to radiative decay and renormalization of its energy levels. When inside a cavity, these quantities can be strongly modified with respect to vacuum. Generally, this modification can be captured by including only the closest resonant cavity mode. In circuit-QED architecture, with substantial coupling strengths, it is however found that such rates are strongly influenced by far off-resonant modes. A multimode calculation over the infinite set of cavity modes leads to divergences unless an artificial cutoff is imposed. Previous studies have not pointed out what the source of this divergence is. We show that unless the effect of {\$}A{\^{}}2{\$} is accounted for up to all orders exactly, any multimode calculations of circuit-QED quantities is bound to diverge. Subsequently, we present the calculation of finite radiative corrections to qubit properties that is free of an artificially introduced high frequency cut-off.},

We employ standard micro-fabrication techniques to pattern each layer, and rely on a vacuum gap between the layers to store the electromagnetic energy. Planar qubits are lithographically defined as an aperture in a conducting boundary of the resonators.

abstract = {Quantum computers can be used to address molecular structure, materials science and condensed matter physics problems, which currently stretch the limits of existing high-performance computing resources. Finding exact numerical solutions to these interacting fermion problems has exponential cost, while Monte Carlo methods are plagued by the fermionic sign problem. These limitations of classical computational methods have made even few-atom molecular structures problems of practical interest for medium-sized quantum computers. Yet, thus far experimental implementations have been restricted to molecules involving only Period I elements. Here, we demonstrate the experimental optimization of up to six-qubit Hamiltonian problems with over a hundred Pauli terms, determining the ground state energy for molecules of increasing size, up to BeH2. This is enabled by a hardware-efficient quantum optimizer with trial states specifically tailored to the available interactions in our quantum processor, combined with a compact encoding of fermionic Hamiltonians and a robust stochastic optimization routine. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by applying the technique to a problem of quantum magnetism. Across all studied problems, we find agreement between experiment and numerical simulations with a noisy model of the device. These results help elucidate the requirements for scaling the method to larger systems, and aim at bridging the gap between problems at the forefront of high-performance computing and their implementation on quantum hardware.},

abstract = {Radio Frequency driven Josephson circuits provide a rich platform to engineer a variety of nonlinear Hamiltonians for superconducting quantum circuits. While Josephson junctions mediate strong interactions between microwave photons, some particular types of interaction Hamiltonians can only be obtained through the application of microwave drives (pumps) at well-chosen frequencies. For various applications, it is important to increase the pump strength without introducing undesired couplings and interferences that limit the fidelity of the operations. In this Letter, we analyze these limitations through the theoretical study of the steady state behavior of the driven-dissipative systems. Our general analysis, based on the Floquet-Markov theory, indicates that the ubiquitous circuit consisting of a transmon coupled to a harmonic oscillator suffers from strong limitations in this regard. In accordance with a parallel experimental study, we find that above a fairly low critical pump power the transmon state escapes the Josephson potential confinement and is sent to a statistical mixture of free-particle like states. Next, we illustrate that by diluting the non-linearity of the Josephson junction through a parallel inductive shunt, the picture changes significantly and one achieves very large dynamic ranges in the pump power. This theoretical study provides the ground for drastic modifications in Josephson circuit designs to be used in parametric Hamiltonian engineering experiments.},

We apply the method to two models: one from ecology and one from epidemiology, achieving a reduction in model dimension and illustrating the high quality of the analytical approximations.

As the device is in the regime where the anharmonicity is on the order of the linewidth, the bistability appears for a drive strength of only a few photons. We measure the dynamics of the bistability by continuously observing the jumps between the two metastable states, which occur with a rate ranging from a few Hz down to a few mHz. The switching rate strongly depends on the drive strength, pump strength and the temperature, following Kramer's law. The interplay between nonlinearity and coupling, in this little explored regime, could provide a new resource for nondemolition measurements, single photon switches or even elements for autonomous quantum error correction.},

abstract = {In contrast to a single quantum bit, an oscillator can store multiple excitations and coherences provided one has the ability to generate and manipulate complex multiphoton states. We demonstrate multiphoton control by using a superconducting transmon qubit coupled to a waveguide cavity resonator with a highly ideal off-resonant coupling. This dispersive interaction is much greater than decoherence rates and higher-order nonlinearities to allow simultaneous manipulation of hundreds of photons. With a tool set of conditional qubit-photon logic, we mapped an arbitrary qubit state to a superposition of coherent states, known as a "cat state." We created cat states as large as 111 photons and extended this protocol to create superpositions of up to four coherent states. This control creates a powerful interface between discrete and continuous variable quantum computation and could enable applications in metrology and quantum information processing.},

Within a densely integrated device, they can protect qubits from noise and serve as quantum memory units. Whether constructed by machining bulk pieces of metal or microfabricating wafers, 3D enclosures are typically assembled from two or more parts. The resulting seams potentially dissipate crossing currents and limit performance. In this Letter, we present measured quality factors of superconducting cavity resonators of several materials, dimensions and seam locations. We observe that superconducting indium can be a low-loss RF conductor and form low-loss seams. Leveraging this, we create a superconducting micromachined resonator with indium that has a quality factor of two million despite a greatly reduced mode volume. Inter-layer coupling to this type of resonator is achieved by an aperture located under a planar transmission line. The described techniques demonstrate a proof-of-principle for multilayer microwave integrated quantum circuits for scalable quantum computing.},

The ancilla is strongly coupled to a transmission line resonator.

We demonstrated single-shot, projective measurement of a single nuclear spin in diamond using a quantum nondemolition measurement scheme, which allows real-time observation of an individual nuclear spin's state in a room-temperature solid.

abstract = {Traumatic brain injury is an increasingly common affliction, although many of its serious repercussions are still underappreciated. A frequent consequence is the development of light-induced pain, or ‘photalgia', which can often lead to prolonged debilitation. The mechanism underlying the sensitivity to light, however, remains unresolved. Since tissue oedema (swelling) is a common feature of traumatic brain injury, we propose that the brainstem oedema, in particular, might sensitize the brainstem trigeminal complex to signals from ocular mechanisms activated in bright light. To assess this hypothesis, we ran high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brainstems of concussion groups with mild and severe photalgia, without photalgia, and healthy controls. The 3D configuration of the brainstem was determined by Tensor-Based Morphometry (TBM) for each participant. The TBM revealed significant deviations in the brainstem morphology of all concussion groups, with a characteristic signature for each group. In particular, concussion without photalgia showed bilateral expansion at the pontine/medulla junction, whereas concussion with photalgia showed mid-pontine shrinkage, consistent with degeneration of nuclei of the trigeminal complex. These results support the hypothesis that brainstem shrinkage/degeneration represents a morphological substrate of the photalgic sensitization of the trigeminal pathway.},

abstract = {We propose a scheme for implementing cross Kerr nonlinearity between two superconducting transmission line resonators (TLR) via their interaction with a coupler which is constructed by two superconducting charge qubits connected to each other via a superconducting quantum interference device. When suitably driven, the coupler can induce very strong cross phase modulation (XPM) between the two TLRs due to its N-type level structure and the consequent electromagnetically induced transparency in its lowest states. The flexibility of our design can lead to various inter-TLR coupling configurations. The obtained cross Kerr coefficient is large enough to allow many important quantum operations in which only few photons are involved. We further show that this scheme is very robust against the fluctuations in solid state circuits. Our numerical calculations imply that the absorption and dispersion resulted from the decoherence of the coupler are very small compared with the strength of the proposed XPM.},

abstract = {Feedback loops are central to most classical control procedures. A controller compares the signal measured by a sensor (system output) with the target value or set-point. It then adjusts an actuator (system input) to stabilize the signal around the target value. Generalizing this scheme to stabilize a micro-system's quantum state relies on quantum feedback 1–3 , which must overcome a fundamental dif-ficulty: the sensor measurements cause a random back-action on the system. An optimal compromise uses weak measurements 4,5 , providing partial information with minimal perturbation. The con-troller should include the effect of this perturbation in the computa-tion of the actuator's operation, which brings the incrementally perturbed state closer to the target. Although some aspects of this scenario have been experimentally demonstrated for the control of quantum 6–9 or classical 10,11 micro-system variables, continuous feed-back loop operations that permanently stabilize quantum systems around a target state have not yet been realized. Here we have imple-mented such a real-time stabilizing quantum feedback scheme 12 fol-lowing a method inspired by ref. 13. It prepares on demand photon number states (Fock states) of a microwave field in a superconduct-ing cavity, and subsequently reverses the effects of decoherence-induced field quantum jumps 14–16},

A continuous measurement record is used to reconstruct the individual quantum trajectories of the qubit state, and quantum state tomography is performed to verify that the state has been tracked accurately.

However, at the single-electron level, required quantum noise—generated by quantum fluctuations and throwing offset charges into the device—presents a real problem in manipulating the delicate quantum states of the qubits. Manucharyan et al. (p. 113) present a clever piece of quantum circuit engineering that can suppress the effect of the quantum noise and allow the quantum circuit to operate without disturbance.The promise of single Cooper-pair quantum circuits based on tunnel junctions for metrology and quantum information applications is severely limited by the influence of offset charges: random, slowly drifting microscopic charges inherent in many solid-state systems. By shunting a small junction with the Josephson kinetic inductance of a series array of large-capacitance tunnel junctions, thereby ensuring that all superconducting islands are connected to the circuit by at least one large junction, we have realized a new superconducting artificial atom that is totally insensitive to offset charges. Yet its energy levels manifest the anharmonic structure associated with single Cooper-pair effects, a useful component for solid-state quantum computation.},

Recent experiments have shown that quantum information generated in qubits can be converted to vibrations in mechanical resonators, which resemble miniature drum skins or piano strings.

abstract = {In quantum physics, measurement results are random but their statistics can be predicted assuming some knowledge about the system in the past. Additional knowledge from a future measurement deeply changes the statistics in the present and leads to purely quantum features. In particular conditioned average outcomes of a weak measurement, so-called weak values, were shown to go beyond the conventional range, give a way to directly measure complex quantities, and can be used to enhance the sensitivity of quantum meters. Recently, these concepts have been considered in the general case of open quantum systems where decoherence occurs. Then, what are the properties of weak values for the unavoidable measurement associated to decoherence, the one performed by the environment? Here, we answer this question in the simplest open quantum system: a quantum bit in presence of a relaxation channel. We continuously monitor the fluorescence emitted by a superconducting qubit driven at resonance. Conditioned on initial preparation and final single shot measurement outcome of the qubit state, we probe weak values displaying all the above properties. The fluorescence signal exhibits interferences between oscillations associated to past and future quantum states. The measured data are in complete agreement with theory.},

Focusing on the case of a Josephson junction embedded in a transmission-line resonator, we solve for the normal modes of the system by taking into account exactly the effect of the quadratic (i.e., inductive) part of the Josephson potential. The nonlinearity is then found to lead to self and cross-Kerr effects, as well as beam-splitter-type interactions between modes. By adjusting the parameters of the circuit, the Kerr coefficient K can be made to reach values that are weak (K{\textless}$\kappa$), strong (K{\textgreater}$\kappa$), or even very strong (K≫$\kappa$) with respect to the photon-loss rate $\kappa$. In the latter case, the resonator+junction circuit corresponds to an in-line version of the transmon. By replacing the single junction by a SQUID, the Kerr coefficient can be tuned in situ, allowing, for example, the fast generation of Schr{\"{o}}dinger cat states of microwave light.

abstract = {The ability to engineer and manipulate different types of quantum mechanical objects allows us to take advantage of their unique properties and create useful hybrid technologies. Thus far, complex quantum states and exquisite quantum control have been demonstrated in systems ranging from trapped ions to superconducting resonators. Recently, there have been many efforts to extend these demonstrations to the motion of complex, macroscopic objects. These mechanical objects have important applications as quantum memories or transducers for measuring and connecting different types of quantum systems. In particular, there have been a few experiments that couple motion to nonlinear quantum objects such as superconducting qubits. This opens up the possibility of creating, storing, and manipulating non-Gaussian quantum states in mechanical degrees of freedom. However, before sophisticated quantum control of mechanical motion can be achieved, we must realize systems with long coherence times while maintaining a sufficient interaction strength. These systems should be implemented in a simple and robust manner that allows for increasing complexity and scalability in the future. Here we experimentally demonstrate a high frequency bulk acoustic wave resonator that is strongly coupled to a superconducting qubit using piezoelectric transduction. In contrast to previous experiments with qubit-mechanical systems, our device requires only simple fabrication methods, extends coherence times to many microseconds, and provides controllable access to a multitude of phonon modes. We use this system to demonstrate basic quantum operations on the coupled qubit-phonon system. Straightforward improvements to the current device will allow for advanced protocols analogous to what has been shown in optical and microwave resonators, resulting in a novel resource for implementing hybrid quantum technologies.},

abstract = {We present a circuit construction for a new fixed-frequency superconducting qubit and show how it can be scaled up to a grid with strictly local interactions. The circuit QED realization we propose implements {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}z{\$}-type coupling between a superconducting qubit and any number of {\$}LC{\$} resonators. The resulting $\backslash$textit{\{}longitudinal coupling{\}} is inherently different from the usual {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}x{\$}-type $\backslash$textit{\{}transverse coupling{\}}, which is the one that has been most commonly used for superconducting qubits. In a grid of fixed-frequency qubits and resonators with a particular pattern of always-on interactions, coupling is strictly confined to nearest and next-nearest neighbor resonators; there is never any direct qubit-qubit coupling. We note that just four distinct resonator frequencies, and only a single unique qubit frequency, suffice for the scalability of this scheme. A controlled phase gate between two neighboring qubits can be realized with microwave drives on the qubits, without affecting the other qubits. This fact is a supreme advantage for the scalability of this scheme.},

@article{Ofek2016,
abstract = {The remarkable discovery of Quantum Error Correction (QEC), which can overcome the errors experienced by a bit of quantum information (qubit), was a critical advance that gives hope for eventually realizing practical quantum computers. In principle, a system that implements QEC can actually pass a "break-even" point and preserve quantum information for longer than the lifetime of its constituent parts. Reaching the break-even point, however, has thus far remained an outstanding and challenging goal. Several previous works have demonstrated elements of QEC in NMR, ions, nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, photons, and superconducting transmons. However, these works primarily illustrate the signatures or scaling properties of QEC codes rather than test the capacity of the system to extend the lifetime of quantum information over time. Here we demonstrate a QEC system that reaches the break-even point by suppressing the natural errors due to energy loss for a qubit logically encoded in superpositions of coherent states, or cat states of a superconducting resonator. Moreover, the experiment implements a full QEC protocol by using real-time feedback to encode, monitor naturally occurring errors, decode, and correct. As measured by full process tomography, the enhanced lifetime of the encoded information is 320 microseconds without any post-selection. This is 20 times greater than that of the system's transmon, over twice as long as an uncorrected logical encoding, and 10{\%} longer than the highest quality element of the system (the resonator's 0, 1 Fock states). Our results illustrate the power of novel, hardware efficient qubit encodings over traditional QEC schemes. Furthermore, they advance the field of experimental error correction from confirming the basic concepts to exploring the metrics that drive system performance and the challenges in implementing a fault-tolerant system.},

Here we review recent progress in theory and experiment related to such quantum input-output networks, with a focus on the SLH framework, a powerful modeling framework for networked quantum systems that is naturally endowed with properties such as modularity and hierarchy. We begin by explaining the physical approximations required to represent any individual node of a network, eg. atoms in cavity or a mechanical oscillator, and its coupling to quantum fields by an operator triple {\$}(S,L,H){\$}. Then we explain how these nodes can be composed into a network with arbitrary connectivity, including coherent feedback channels, using algebraic rules, and how to derive the dynamics of network components and output fields. The second part of the review discusses several extensions to the basic SLH framework that expand its modeling capabilities, and the prospects for modeling integrated implementations of quantum input-output networks. In addition to summarizing major results and recent literature, we discuss the potential applications and limitations of the SLH framework and quantum input-output networks, with the intention of providing context to a reader unfamiliar with the field.},

We assume that the qubits are dispersively coupled to a distributed microwave structure such that the detunings of the qubits from the internal modes of the microwave structure are stronger than their couplings. We define qubit ports across the terminals of the Josephson junctions and drive ports where transmission lines carrying drive signals reach the chip and we obtain the multiport impedance response of the linear passive part of the system between the ports. We then relate interaction parameters in between qubits and between the qubits and the environment to the entries of this multiport impedance function: in particular we show that the exchange coupling rate J between qubits is related in a simple way to the off-diagonal entry connecting the qubit ports. Similarly we relate couplings of the qubits to voltage drives and lossy environment to the entries connecting the qubits and the drive ports. Our treatment takes into account all the modes (possibly infinite) that might be present in the distributed electromagnetic structure and provides an efficient method for the modeling and analysis of the circuits.},

This residual thermal population, of the order of {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}--{\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}, is suspected to arise from noise impinging on the resonator from its input and output ports. To address this problem, we designed and tested a new type of band-pass microwave attenuator that consists of a dissipative cavity well thermalized to the mixing chamber stage of a dilution refrigerator. By adding such a cavity attenuator inline with a 3D superconducting cavity housing a transmon qubit, we have reproducibly measured increased qubit coherence times.

Here, we experimentally demonstrate and analyze a scheme for tuning the coupling between a transmon qubit and a microwave resonator using a single coherent drive tone. We treat the transmon as a three-level system with the qubit subspace defined by the ground and the second excited states. If the drive frequency matches the difference between the resonator and the qubit frequency, a Jaynes-Cummings type interaction is induced, which is tunable both in amplitude and phase. We show that coupling strengths of about 10 MHz can be achieved in our setup, limited only by the anharmonicity of the transmon qubit. This scheme has been successfully used to generate microwave photons with controlled temporal shape [Pechal et al., Phys. Rev.

We demonstrate tunable coupling, a basic building block for quantum annealing, between two flux qubits with small ({\$}\backslashsim 50{\~{}}\backslashmathrm{\{}nA{\}}{\$}) persistent currents. Furthermore, we characterize qubit coherence as a function of coupler setting and investigate the effect of flux noise in the coupler loop on qubit coherence. Our results provide insight into the available design space for next-generation quantum annealers with improved coherence.},

abstract = {This thesis presents experimental work aimed at observing the quantum Zeno dynamics (QZD) in 3D circuit-QED, where an artificial atom, consisting of a superconducting circuit called a transmon, is coupled to the electric field of a microwave cavity resonator. The transmon and resonator energy levels are aligned in a novel way enabling the manipulation of individual Fock states of the cavity, while minimizing its transmon-induced Kerr non-linearity. We induce the QZD by displacing  classically the cavity field while continuously driving strongly a transmon transition  specific to a particular Fock state, which keeps this Fock state population at zero. The QZD is then observed by measuring the Wigner function of the fields at regular time intervals, either by Wigner tomography or standard quantum tomography and reconstruction of the density matrix. We observe three examples of QZD, and analyze the observed decoherence with the help of quantum simulations of the system.},

In particular, superconducting quantum circuits have successfully demonstrated many of the requirements for quantum computing, including coherence levels that approach the thresholds for scaling. However, it remains challenging to couple a large number of circuit components through controllable channels while suppressing any other interactions. We propose a hardware platform intended to address these challenges, which combines the advantages of integrated circuit fabrication and long coherence times achievable in three-dimensional circuit quantum electrodynamics (3D cQED). This multilayer microwave integrated quantum circuit (MMIQC) platform provides a path toward the realization of increasingly complex superconducting devices in pursuit of a scalable quantum computer.},

The design by E-beam lithography of strongly asymmetric undercuts on a bilayer resist enables in-situ fabrication of junctions and capacitors without the use of the well-known suspended bridge[1]. The absence of bridges increases the mechanical robustness of the resist mask as well as the accessible range of the junction size, from 0.01 to more than 10000 micron square. We have fabricated Al/AlOx/Al Josephson junctions, phase qubit and capacitors using a 100kV E- beam writer. Although this high voltage enables a precise control of the undercut, implementation using a conventional 20kV E-beam is also discussed. The phase qubit coherence times, extracted from spectroscopy resonance width, Rabi and Ramsey oscillations decay and energy relaxation measurements, are longer than the ones obtained in our previous samples realized by standard techniques. These results demonstrate the high quality of the junction obtained by this controlled undercut technique.},

abstract = {A recent experiment by Minev et. al [arXiv:1803.00545] demonstrated that in a dissipative (artificial) 3-level atom with strongly intermittent dynamics it is possible to "catch and reverse" a quantum jump "mid-flight": by the conditional application of a unitary perturbation after a fixed time with no jumps, the system was prevented from getting shelved in the dark state, thus removing the intermittency from the dynamics. Here we offer an interpretation of this phenomenon in terms of the dynamical large deviation formalism for open quantum dynamics. In this approach, intermittency is seen as the first-order coexistence of active and inactive dynamical phases. Dark periods are thus like space-time bubbles of the inactive phase in the active one. Here we consider a controlled dynamics via the (single - as in the experiment - or multiple) application of a unitary control pulse during no-jump periods. By considering the large deviation statistics of the emissions, we show that appropriate choice of the control allows to stabilise a desired dynamical phase and remove the intermittency. In the thermodynamic analogy, the effect of the control is to prick bubbles thus preventing the fluctuations that manifest phase coexistence. We discuss similar controlled dynamics in broader settings.},

@article{Lescanne2018,
abstract = {Josephson circuits have been ideal systems to study complex non-linear dynamics which can lead to chaotic behavior and instabilities. More recently, Josephson circuits in the quantum regime, particularly in the presence of microwave drives, have demonstrated their ability to emulate a variety of Hamiltonians that are useful for the processing of quantum information. In this paper we show that these drives lead to an instability which results in the escape of the circuit mode into states that are not confined by the Josephson cosine potential. We observe this escape in a ubiquitous circuit: a transmon embedded in a 3D cavity. When the transmon occupies these free-particle-like states, the circuit behaves as though the junction had been removed, and all non-linearities are lost. This work deepens our understanding of strongly driven Josephson circuits, which is important for fundamental and application perspectives, such as the engineering of Hamiltonians by parametric pumping.},

abstract = {We consider an open quantum system described by a Lindblad-type master equation with two times-scales. The fast time-scale is strongly dissipative and drives the system towards a low-dimensional decoherence-free space. To perform the adiabatic elimination of this fast relaxation, we propose a geometric asymptotic expansion based on the small positive parameter describing the time-scale separation. This expansion exploits geometric singular perturbation theory and center-manifold techniques. We conjecture that, at any order, it provides an effective slow Lindblad master equation and a completely positive parameterization of the slow invariant sub-manifold associated to the low-dimensional decoherence-free space. By preserving complete positivity and trace, two important structural properties attached to open quantum dynamics, we obtain a reduced-order model that directly conveys a physical interpretation since it relies on effective Lindbladian descriptions of the slow evolution. At the first order, we derive simple formulae for the effective Lindblad master equation. For a specific type of fast dissipation, we show how any Hamiltonian perturbation yields Lindbladian second-order corrections to the first-order slow evolution governed by the Zeno-Hamiltonian. These results are illustrated on a composite system made of a strongly dissipative harmonic oscillator, the ancilla, weakly coupled to another quantum system.},

We believe that the next significant step will be to demonstrate a quantum memory, in which a system of interacting qubits stores an encoded logical qubit state longer than the incorporated parts. Here, we describe the important route towards a logical memory with superconducting qubits, employing a rotated version of the surface code. The current status of technology with regards to interconnected superconducting-qubit networks will be described and near-term areas of focus to improve devices will be identified. Overall, the progress in this exciting field has been astounding, but we are at an important turning point, where it will be critical to incorporate engineering solutions with quantum architectural considerations, laying the foundation towards scalable fault-tolerant quantum computers in the near future.},

Much of the material for it is drawn from arXiv:1003.5209, arXiv:1401.7254, and arXiv:1405.2390. However there are substantial additions of original material in Sections 4, 7, 8 and 9, along with clarifications and expansions of the older content throughout. Topics include the meaning of subjective probability; no-cloning, teleportation, and quantum tomography from the subjectivist Bayesian perspective; the message QBism receives from Bell inequality violations (namely, that nature is creative); the import of symmetric informationally complete (SIC) quantum measurements for the technical side of QBism; quantum cosmology QBist-style; and a potential meaning for the holographic principle within QBism.},

abstract = {Recent progress in solid state quantum information processing has stimulated the search for ultra-low-noise amplifiers and frequency converters in the microwave frequency range, which could attain the ultimate limit imposed by quantum mechanics. In this article, we report the first realization of an intrinsically phase-preserving, non-degenerate superconducting parametric amplifier, a so far missing component. It is based on the Josephson ring modulator, which consists of four junctions in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. The device symmetry greatly enhances the purity of the amplification process and simplifies both its operation and analysis. The measured characteristics of the amplifier in terms of gain and bandwidth are in good agreement with analytical predictions. Using a newly developed noise source, we also show that our device operates within a factor of three of the quantum limit. This development opens new applications in the area of quantum analog signal processing.},

@article{Macklin2015,
abstract = {Amplifying microwave signals with high gain and across a broad range of frequencies is crucial in solid-state quantum information processing (QIP). Achieving broadband operation is especially tricky. Macklin et al. engineered an amplifier that contains a long chain of so-called Josephson junctions (see the Perspective by Cleland). The amplifier exhibited high gain over a gigahertz-sized bandwidth and was able to perform high-fidelity qubit readout. Because the amplifier will be capable of reading out as many as 20 qubits simultaneously, it may help to scale up QIP protocols.Science, this issue p. 307; see also p. 280Detecting single{\{}$\backslash$textendash{\}}photon level signals{\{}$\backslash$textemdash{\}}carriers of both classical and quantum information{\{}$\backslash$textemdash{\}}is particularly challenging for low-energy microwave frequency excitations. Here we introduce a superconducting amplifier based on a Josephson junction transmission line. Unlike current standing-wave parametric amplifiers, this traveling wave architecture robustly achieves high gain over a bandwidth of several gigahertz with sufficient dynamic range to read out 20 superconducting qubits. To achieve this performance, we introduce a subwavelength resonant phase-matching technique that enables the creation of nonlinear microwave devices with unique dispersion relations. We benchmark the amplifier with weak measurements, obtaining a high quantum efficiency of 75{\%} (70{\%} including noise added by amplifiers following the Josephson amplifier). With a flexible design based on compact lumped elements, this Josephson amplifier has broad applicability to microwave metrology and quantum optics.},

Our method starts by calculating the normal modes of the linearized circuit and proceeds with numerical diagonalization in this basis.

While elementary, this simple example is nontrivial because it cannot be efficiently treated by the method known as "black-box quantization," numerical diagonalization in the bare harmonic oscillator basis, or perturbation theory.

abstract = {Recent research in superconducting quantum circuits operating close to the quantum limit results in the need of a quantum mechanical treatment of losses. Of special interest is the dynamic behaviour of an open quantum system. As an example, a negative-resistance Josephson parametric amplifier is treated. The DC bias voltage is chosen such that a strong interaction between the Josephson junction and the two resonant circuits, the signal and the idler circuit, is achieved. Power exchange occurs between the two considered resonator modes and also between the resonator modes and the DC power supply. Losses in the resonators are modeled by the quantum Langevin method, which describes the losses by coupling the resonators to a heat bath representing a photon gas in thermal equilibrium. The derived dynamic behaviour does not provide signal energy saturation, like classically expected for parametric amplifiers. Introducing a phenomenological multi-photon coupling approach, saturation of the amplified signal is ensured. The time evolution of the signal and noise energy is calculated and numerically evaluated for a specific example in cases of both, the quantum Langevin method with and without the phenomenological multi-photon coupling approach.

Understanding the energy distribution of these quasiparticles will yield insight into their generation mechanisms, the limitations they impose on superconducting devices, and how to efficiently mitigate quasiparticle-induced qubit decoherence. To probe this energy distribution, we systematically correlate qubit relaxation and excitation with charge-parity switches in an offset-charge-sensitive transmon qubit, and find that quasiparticle-induced excitation events are the dominant mechanism behind the residual excited-state population in our samples. By itself, the observed quasiparticle distribution would limit {\$}T{\_}1{\$} to {\$}\backslashapprox\backslashnlb200{\~{}}\backslashus{\$}, which indicates that quasiparticle loss in our devices is on equal footing with all other loss mechanisms.

Our method relies on the definition of the Environment Algebra, a relevant von Neumann algebra of the environment. With this algebra we define the classical parts of the environment and prove a decomposition between a maximal classical part and a quantum part. Then we investigate what other information can be obtained via this algebra, which leads us to define a more pertinent algebra: the Environment Action Algebra. This second algebra is linked to the minimal Stinespring representations induced by the unitary evolution on the system. Finally, in finite dimension we give a characterization of both algebras in terms of the spectrum of a certain completely positive map acting on the states of the environment.},

This a challenge with superconducting circuits, as state-of-the-art architectures rely on only nearest-neighbor coupling. Here, we implement a random access superconducting quantum information processor, demonstrating universal operations on a nine-qubit memory, with a Josephson junction transmon circuit serving as the central processor. The quantum memory uses the eigenmodes of a linear array of coupled superconducting resonators. We selectively stimulate vacuum Rabi oscillations between the transmon and individual eigenmodes through parametric flux modulation of the transmon frequency. Utilizing these oscillations, we perform a universal set of quantum gates on 38 arbitrary pairs of modes and prepare multimode entangled states, all using only two control lines. We thus achieve hardware-efficient random access multi-qubit control in an architecture compatible with long-lived microwave cavity-based quantum memories.},

By addressing the combined qubit-cavity states of a superconducting transmon qubit in a three-dimensional copper cavity with two microwave drives we establish an effective [Lambda] system, two legs of which are defined by a dipole transition and a two-photon transition. This circuit-based system allows the observation of three-microwave-photon Raman coherence effects, including coherent population trapping and EIT, which are demonstrated here with both steady-state spectroscopic techniques and time-domain measurements. By sending Gaussian microwave pulses through the cavity in the EIT regime, a negative group velocity of the pulse is observed with the peak of the pulse exiting the cavity 9.4[thinsp][mu]s before entering.},

In addition to the usual symmetric plasma mode (s mode) which gives rise to the phase qubit, an antisymmetric mode (a mode) appears. These two modes can be described by two anharmonic oscillators with eigenstates |ns{\textgreater} and |na{\textgreater} for the s and a mode, respectively. We show that a strong nonlinear coupling between the modes leads to a large energy splitting between states |0s,1a{\textgreater} and |2s,0a{\textgreater}.

@article{Murch2013a,
abstract = {The length of time that a quantum system can exist in a superposition state is determined by how strongly it interacts with its environment. This interaction entangles the quantum state with the inherent fluctuations of the environment. If these fluctuations are not measured, the environment can be viewed as a source of noise, causing random evolution of the quantum system from an initially pure state into a statistical mixture-a process known as decoherence. However, by accurately measuring the environment in real time, the quantum system can be maintained in a pure state and its time evolution described by a quantum trajectory conditioned on the measurement outcome. We employ weak measurements to monitor a microwave cavity embedding a superconducting qubit and track the individual quantum trajectories of the system. In this architecture, the environment is dominated by the fluctuations of a single electromagnetic mode of the cavity. Using a near-quantum-limited parametric amplifier, we selectively measure either the phase or amplitude of the cavity field, and thereby confine trajectories to either the equator or a meridian of the Bloch sphere. We perform quantum state tomography at discrete times along the trajectory to verify that we have faithfully tracked the state of the quantum system as it diffuses on the surface of the Bloch sphere. Our results demonstrate that decoherence can be mitigated by environmental monitoring and validate the foundations of quantum feedback approaches based on Bayesian statistics. Moreover, our experiments suggest a new route for implementing what Schrodinger termed "quantum steering"-harnessing action at a distance to manipulate quantum states via measurement.},

@article{Minev2018-jumps,
abstract = {A quantum system driven by a weak deterministic force while under strong continuous energy measurement exhibits quantum jumps between its energy levels. This celebrated phenomenon is emblematic of the special nature of randomness in quantum physics. The times at which the jumps occur are reputed to be fundamentally unpredictable. However, certain classical phenomena, like tsunamis, while unpredictable in the long term, may possess a degree of predictability in the short term, and in some cases it may be possible to prevent a disaster by detecting an advance warning signal. Can there be, despite the indeterminism of quantum physics, a possibility to know if a quantum jump is about to occur or not? In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively by experimentally demonstrating that the completed jump from the ground to an excited state of a superconducting artificial atom can be tracked, as it follows its predictable "flight," by monitoring the population of an auxiliary level coupled to the ground state. Furthermore, we show that the completed jump is continuous, deterministic, and coherent. Exploiting this coherence, we catch and reverse a quantum jump mid-flight, thus preventing its completion. This real-time intervention is based on a particular lull period in the population of the auxiliary level, which serves as our advance warning signal. Our results, which agree with theoretical predictions essentially without adjustable parameters, support the modern quantum trajectory theory and provide new ground for the exploration of real-time intervention techniques in the control of quantum systems, such as early detection of error syndromes.},

However for the simplest system capable of exhibiting contextuality, a qutrit, the quantum contextuality is verified only state-dependently in experiment because too many (at least 31) observables are involved in all the known state-independent tests. Here we report an experimentally testable inequality involving only 13 observables that is satisfied by all non-contextual realistic models while being violated by all qutrit states. Thus our inequality will practically facilitate a state-independent test of the quantum contextuality for an indivisible quantum system. We provide also a record-breaking state-independent proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem with 13 directions determined by 26 points on the surface of a three by three magic cube.},

abstract = {Electron spins and photons are complementary quantum-mechanical objects that can be used to carry, manipulate, and transform quantum information. To combine these resources, it is desirable to achieve the coherent coupling of a single spin to photons stored in a superconducting resonator. Using a circuit design based on a nanoscale spin valve, we coherently hybridize the individual spin and charge states of a double quantum dot while preserving spin coherence. This scheme allows us to achieve spin-photon coupling up to the megahertz range at the single-spin level. The cooperativity is found to reach 2.3, and the spin coherence time is about 60 nanoseconds. We thereby demonstrate a mesoscopic device suitable for nondestructive spin readout and distant spin coupling.},

abstract = {A quantum system subjected to a strong continuous monitoring undergoes quantum jumps. This very well known fact hides a neglected subtlety: sharp scale-invariant fluctuations invariably decorate the jump process even in the limit where the measurement rate is very large. This article is devoted to the quantitative study of these remaining fluctuations, which we call spikes, and to a discussion of their physical status. We start by introducing a classical model where the origin of these fluctuations is more intuitive and then jump to the quantum realm where their existence is less intuitive. We compute the exact distribution of the spikes for a continuously monitored qubit. We conclude by discussing their physical and operational relevance.},

@article{Kirchmair2013,
abstract = {To create and manipulate non-classical states of light for quantum information protocols, a strong, nonlinear interaction at the single-photon level is required. One approach to the generation of suitable interactions is to couple photons to atoms, as in the strong coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamic systems. In these systems, however, the quantum state of the light is only indirectly controlled by manipulating the atoms. A direct photon-photon interaction occurs in so-called Kerr media, which typically induce only weak nonlinearity at the cost of significant loss. So far, it has not been possible to reach the single-photon Kerr regime, in which the interaction strength between individual photons exceeds the loss rate. Here, using a three-dimensional circuit quantum electrodynamic architecture, we engineer an artificial Kerr medium that enters this regime and allows the observation of new quantum effects. We realize a gedanken experiment in which the collapse and revival of a coherent state can be observed. This time evolution is a consequence of the quantization of the light field in the cavity and the nonlinear interaction between individual photons. During the evolution, non-classical superpositions of coherent states (that is, multi-component 'Schr{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}dinger cat' states) are formed. We visualize this evolution by measuring the Husimi Q function and confirm the non-classical properties of these transient states by cavity state tomography. The ability to create and manipulate superpositions of coherent states in such a high-quality-factor photon mode opens perspectives for combining the physics of continuous variables with superconducting circuits. The single-photon Kerr effect could be used in quantum non-demolition measurement of photons, single-photon generation, autonomous quantum feedback schemes and quantum logic operations.},

abstract = {The state of a continuously monitored qubit evolves stochastically, exhibiting competition between coherent Hamiltonian dynamics and diffusive partial collapse dynamics that follow the measurement record. We couple these distinct types of dynamics together by linearly feeding the collected record for dispersive energy measurements directly back into a coherent Rabi drive amplitude. Such feed-back turns the competition cooperative, and effectively stabilizes the qubit state near a target state. We derive the conditions for obtaining such dispersive state stabilization and verify the stabiliza-tion conditions numerically. We include common experimental nonidealities, such as energy decay, environmental dephasing, detector efficiency, and feedback delay, and show that the feedback delay has the most significant negative effect on the feedback protocol. Setting the measurement collapse timescale to be long compared to the feedback delay yields the best stabilization.},

We propose an approach to efficiently prepare such cat states in a Kerr-nonlinear resonator by the use of a two-photon drive. Significantly, we show that this preparation is robust against single-photon loss. An outcome of this observation is that a two-photon drive can eliminate undesirable phase evolution induced by a Kerr nonlinearity. By exploiting the concept of transitionless quantum driving, we moreover demonstrate how non-adiabatic initialization of cat states is possible. Finally, we present a universal set of quantum logical gates that can be performed on the engineered eigenspace of such a two-photon driven resonator and discuss a possible realization using superconducting circuits. The robustness of the engineered subspace to higher-order circuit nonlinearities makes this implementation favorable for scalable quantum computation.},

abstract = {Making a system state follow a prescribed trajectory despite fluctuations and errors commonly consists in monitoring an observable (temperature, blood-glucose level...) and reacting on its controllers (heater power, insulin amount ...). In the quantum domain, there is a change of paradigm in feedback since measurements modify the state of the system, most dramatically when the trajectory goes through superpositions of measurement eigenstates. Here, we demonstrate the stabilization of an arbitrary trajectory of a superconducting qubit by measurement based feedback. The protocol benefits from the long coherence time ({\$}T{\_}2{\textgreater}10 \backslashmu{\$}s) of the 3D transmon qubit, the high efficiency (82{\%}) of the phase preserving Josephson amplifier, and fast electronics ensuring less than 500 ns delay. At discrete time intervals, the state of the qubit is measured and corrected in case an error is detected. For Rabi oscillations, where the discrete measurements occur when the qubit is supposed to be in the measurement pointer states, we demonstrate an average fidelity of 85{\%} to the targeted trajectory. For Ramsey oscillations, which does not go through pointer states, the average fidelity reaches 75{\%}. Incidentally, we demonstrate a fast reset protocol allowing to cool a 3D transmon qubit down to 0.6{\%} in the excited state.},

abstract = {We introduce a new multimode cavity QED architecture for superconducting circuits that can be used to implement photonic memories, more efficient Purcell filters, and quantum simulations of photonic materials. We show that qubit interactions mediated by multimode cavities can have exponentially improved contrast for two qubit gates without sacrificing gate speed. Using two qubits coupled via a three-mode cavity system we spectroscopically observe multimode strong couplings up to 102 MHz and demonstrate suppressed interactions off resonance of 10 kHz when the qubits are ≈600 MHz detuned from the cavity resonance. We study Landau-Zener transitions in our multimode systems and demonstrate quasiadiabatic loading of single photons into the multimode cavity in 25 ns. We introduce an adiabatic gate protocol to realize a controlled-Z gate between the qubits in 95 ns and create a Bell state with 94.7{\%} fidelity. This corresponds to an on/off ratio (gate contrast) of 1000.},

@article{Plenio1998,
abstract = {Dissipation, the irreversible loss of energy and coherence, from a microsystem, is the result of coupling to a much larger macrosystem (or reservoir) which is so large that one has no chance of keeping track of all of its degrees of freedom. The microsystem evolution is then described by tracing over the reservoir states, resulting in an irreversible decay as excitation leaks out of the initially excited microsystems into the outer reservoir environment. Earlier treatments of this dissipation described an ensemble of microsystems using density matrices, either in Schroedinger picture with Master equations, or in Heisenberg picture with Langevin equations. The development of experimental techniques to study single quantum systems (for example single trapped ions, or cavity radiation field modes) has stimulated the construction of theoretical methods to describe individual realizations conditioned on a particular observation record of the decay channel, in the environment. These methods, variously described as Quantum Jump, Monte Carlo Wavefunction and Quantum Trajectory methods are the subject of this review article. We discuss their derivation, apply them to a number of current problems in quantum optics and relate them to ensemble descriptions.},

@article{Shankar2013-Nature,
abstract = {Quantum error correction codes are designed to protect an arbitrary state of a multi-qubit register from decoherence-induced errors, but their implementation is an outstanding challenge in the development of large-scale quantum computers. The first step is to stabilize a non-equilibrium state of a simple quantum system, such as a quantum bit (qubit) or a cavity mode, in the presence of decoherence. This has recently been accomplished using measurement-based feedback schemes. The next step is to prepare and stabilize a state of a composite system. Here we demonstrate the stabilization of an entangled Bell state of a quantum register of two superconducting qubits for an arbitrary time. Our result is achieved using an autonomous feedback scheme that combines continuous drives along with a specifically engineered coupling between the two-qubit register and a dissipative reservoir. Similar autonomous feedback techniques have been used for qubit reset, single-qubit state stabilization, and the creation and stabilization of states of multipartite quantum systems. Unlike conventional, measurement-based schemes, the autonomous approach uses engineered dissipation to counteract decoherence, obviating the need for a complicated external feedback loop to correct errors. Instead, the feedback loop is built into the Hamiltonian such that the steady state of the system in the presence of drives and dissipation is a Bell state, an essential building block for quantum information processing. Such autonomous schemes, which are broadly applicable to a variety of physical systems, as demonstrated by the accompanying paper on trapped ion qubits, will be an essential tool for the implementation of quantum error correction.},

The suspicion is expressed that no end will be in sight until a means is found to reduce quantum theory to two or three statements of crisp physical (rather than abstract, axiomatic) significance. In this regard, no tool appears better calibrated for a direct assault than quantum information theory. Far from a strained application of the latest fad to a time-honored problem, this method holds promise precisely because a large part--but not all--of the structure of quantum theory has always concerned information. It is just that the physics community needs reminding. This paper, though taking quant-ph/0106166 as its core, corrects one mistake and offers several observations beyond the previous version. In particular, I identify one element of quantum mechanics that I would not label a subjective term in the theory--it is the integer parameter D traditionally ascribed to a quantum system via its Hilbert-space dimension.},

abstract = {The act of measurement bridges the quantum and classical worlds by projecting a superposition of possible states into a single (probabilistic) outcome. The timescale of this 'instantaneous' process can be stretched using weak measurements, such that it takes the form of a gradual random walk towards a final state. Remarkably, the interim measurement record is sufficient to continuously track and steer the quantum state using feedback. Here we implement quantum feedback control in a solid-state system, namely a superconducting quantum bit (qubit) coupled to a microwave cavity. A weak measurement of the qubit is implemented by probing the cavity with microwave photons, maintaining its average occupation at less than one photon. These photons are then directed to a high-bandwidth, quantum-noise-limited amplifier, which allows real-time monitoring of the state of the cavity (and, hence, that of the qubit) with high fidelity. We demonstrate quantum feedback control by inhibiting the decay of Rabi oscillations, allowing them to persist indefinitely. Such an ability permits the active suppression of decoherence and enables a method of quantum error correction based on weak continuous measurements. Other applications include quantum state stabilization, entanglement generation using measurement, state purification and adaptive measurements.},

This coupling can be tuned from zero to values that are comparable with other superconducting qubits. At g = 0, the qubit is in a decoherence-free subspace with respect to spontaneous emission induced by the Purcell effect. Furthermore, we show that in this decoherence-free subspace, the state of the qubit can still be measured by either a dispersive shift on the resonance frequency of the resonator or by a cycling-type measurement.},

@phdthesis{Gao2008,
abstract = {Over the past decade, low temperature detectors have brought astronomers revolutionary new observational capabilities and led to many great discoveries. Although a single low temperature detector has very impressive sensitivity, a large detector array would be much more powerful and are highly demanded for the study of more difficult and fundamental problems in astronomy. However, current detector technologies, such as transition edge sensors and superconducting tunnel junction detectors, are difficult to integrate into a large array. The microwave kinetic inductance detector (MKID)is a promising new detector technology invented at Caltech and JPL which provides both high sensitivity and an easy solution to the detector integration. It senses the change in the surface impedance of a superconductor as incoming photons break Cooper pairs, by using high-Q superconducting microwave resonators capacitively coupled to a common feedline. This architecture allows thousands of detectors to be easily integrated through passive frequency domain multiplexing. In this thesis, we explore the rich and interesting physics behind these superconducting microwave resonators. The first part of the thesis discusses the surface impedance of a superconductor, the kinetic inductance of a superconducting coplanar waveguide, and the circuit response of a resonator. These topics are related with the responsivity of MKIDs. The second part presents the study of the excess frequency noise that is universally observed in these resonators. The properties of the excess noise, including power, temperature, material, and geometry dependence, have been quantified. The noise source has been identified to be the two-level systems in the dielectric material on the surface of the resonator. A semi-empirical noise model has been developed to explain the power and geometry dependence of the noise, which is useful to predict the noise for a specified resonator geometry. The detailed physical noise mechanism, however, is still not clear. With the theoretical results of the responsivity and the semi-empirical noise model established in this thesis, a prediction of the detector sensitivity (noise equivalent power) and an optimization of the detector design are now possible.},

In this paper, we use a three-level superconducting system (a qutrit) coupled to a microwave cavity to explore different regimes of quantum measurement. In particular, we engineer the dispersive shifts of the cavity frequency to be identical for the first and second excited states of the qutrit which allows us to realize a strong projective binary-outcome measurement onto its ground state with a fidelity of 94.3{\%}. Complemented with standard microwave control and low-noise parametric amplification, this scheme can be used to create sets of compatible measurements to reveal the contextual nature of superconducting circuits.},

These results justify the usual quantum Langevin equations considered in continual quantum measurement or in quantum optics. Physically, the typical Hamiltonian allowing this passage to the limit shows up three different parts which correspond to the free evolution, to an analogue of a weak coupling limit part and to a scattering interaction part. We apply these results to give an Hamiltonian description of the von Neumann measurements.

abstract = {A central feature of quantum mechanics is that a measurement is intrinsically probabilistic. As a result, continuously monitoring a quantum system will randomly perturb its natural unitary evolution. The ability to control a quantum system in the presence of these fluctuations is of increasing importance in quantum information processing and finds application in fields ranging from nuclear magnetic resonance to chemical synthesis. A detailed understanding of this stochastic evolution is essential for the development of optimized control methods. Here we reconstruct the individual quantum trajectories of a superconducting circuit that evolves in competition between continuous weak measurement and driven unitary evolution. By tracking individual trajectories that evolve between an arbitrary choice of initial and final states we can deduce the most probable path through quantum state space. These pre- and post-selected quantum trajectories also reveal the optimal detector signal in the form of a smooth time-continuous function that connects the desired boundary conditions. Our investigation reveals the rich interplay between measurement dynamics, typically associated with wave function collapse, and unitary evolution of the quantum state as described by the Schrodinger equation. These results and the underlying theory, based on a principle of least action, reveal the optimal route from initial to final states, and may enable new quantum control methods for state steering and information processing.},

The achievement of strong coupling, where the coupling between a single atom and fundamental cavity mode exceeds the decay rates, was a major milestone that opened the doors to a multitude of new investigations. Here we introduce multimode strong coupling (MMSC), where the coupling is comparable to the free spectral range (FSR) of the cavity, i.e. the rate at which a qubit can absorb a photon from the cavity is comparable to the round trip transit rate of a photon in the cavity. We realize, via the circuit QED architecture, the first experiment accessing the MMSC regime, and report remarkably widespread and structured resonance fluorescence, whose origin extends beyond cavity enhancement of sidebands. Our results capture complex multimode, multiphoton processes, and the emergence of ultranarrow linewidths. Beyond the novel phenomena presented here, MMSC opens a major new direction in the exploration of light-matter interactions.},

However, symmetries which on one hand protect the system against decoherence yield selection rules which may cancel coupling to the pump external drive. The tradeoff between efficient coupling and decoherence due to broad-band colored noise (BBCN), which is often the main source of decoherence, is addressed in the class of nanodevices based on the Cooper pair box (CPB) design.We study transfer efficiency by STIRAP, showing that substantial efficiency is achieved for off-symmetric bias only in the charge-phase regime. We find a number of results uniquely due to non-Markovianity of BBCN, namely (a) the efficiency for STIRAP depends essentially on noise channels in the trapped subspace; (b) low-frequency fluctuations can be analyzed and represented as fictitious correlated fluctuations of the detunings of the external drives; and (c) a simple figure ofmerit for design and operating prescriptions allowing the observation of STIRAP is proposed. The emerging physical picture also applies to other classes of coherent nanodevices subject to BBCN. DOI:},

Using measurement only, control of the state can be achieved if the observable is slowly varied such that the state tracks the now time-dependent eigenstate. We demonstrate this using a circuit-QED readout technique that couples to a dynamically controllable observable of a qubit. Continuous monitoring of the measurement record allows us to detect an escape from the eigenstate, thus serving as a built-in form of error detection. We show this by post-selecting on realizations with arbitrarily high fidelity with respect to the target state.

Such observables, typically multi-qubit parities such as {\textless}XXXX{\textgreater}, must correspond to a special symmetry property inherent to the encoding scheme. Measurements of these observables, or error syndromes, must also be performed in a quantum non-demolition (QND) way and faster than the rate at which errors occur. Previously, QND measurements of quantum jumps between energy eigenstates have been performed in systems such as trapped ions, electrons, cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, and superconducting qubits. So far, however, no fast and repeated monitoring of an error syndrome has been realized. Here, we track the quantum jumps of a possible error syndrome, the photon number parity of a microwave cavity, by mapping this property onto an ancilla qubit. This quantity is just the error syndrome required in a recently proposed scheme for a hardware-efficient protected quantum memory using Schr$\backslash$"{\{}o{\}}dinger cat states in a harmonic oscillator. We demonstrate the projective nature of this measurement onto a parity eigenspace by observing the collapse of a coherent state onto even or odd cat states. The measurement is fast compared to the cavity lifetime, has a high single-shot fidelity, and has a 99.8{\%} probability per single measurement of leaving the parity unchanged. In combination with the deterministic encoding of quantum information in cat states realized earlier, our demonstrated QND parity tracking represents a significant step towards implementing an active system that extends the lifetime of a quantum bit.},

abstract = {By placing an atom into a cavity, the electromagnetic mode structure of the cavity is modified. In Cavity QED, one manifestation of this phenomenon is the appearance of a gauge-dependent diamagnetic term, known as the {\$}A{\^{}}2{\$} contribution. Although in atomic Cavity QED, the resulting modification in the eigenmodes is negligible, in recent superconducting circuit realizations, such corrections can be observable and may have qualitative implications. We revisit the canonical quantization procedure of a circuit QED system consisting of a single superconducting transmon qubit coupled to a multimode superconducting microwave resonator. A complete derivation of the quantum Hamiltonian of an open circuit QED system consisting of a transmon qubit coupled to a leaky transmission line cavity is presented. We introduce a complete set of modes that properly conserves the current in the entire structure and present a sum rule for the dipole transition matrix elements of a multi-level transmon qubit coupled to a multi-mode cavity. Finally, an effective multi-mode Rabi model is derived with coefficients that are given in terms of circuit parameters.},

abstract = {Manipulating the state of a logical quantum bit usually comes at the expense of exposing it to decoherence. Fault-tolerant quantum computing tackles this problem by manipulating quantum information within a stable manifold of a larger Hilbert space, whose symmetries restrict the number of independent errors. The remaining errors do not affect the quantum computation and are correctable after the fact. Here we implement the autonomous stabilization of an encoding manifold spanned by Schroedinger cat states in a superconducting cavity. We show Zeno-driven coherent oscillations between these states analogous to the Rabi rotation of a qubit protected against phase-flips. Such gates are compatible with quantum error correction and hence are crucial for fault-tolerant logical qubits.},

Yet when two superconductors are separated by a thin nonsuperconducting bridge (the {\{}$\backslash$textquotedblleft{\}}weak link{\{}$\backslash$textquotedblright{\}}), quasi-particles can occupy states that are inside the gap, the so-called Andreev bound states (ABSs).

As part of this ongoing effort, devices for quantum information processing, secure communication, and high-precision sensing are being implemented with diverse systems, ranging from photons, atoms, and spins to mesoscopic superconducting and nanomechanical structures. Their physical properties make some of these systems better suited than others for specific tasks; thus, photons are well suited for transmitting quantum information, weakly interacting spins can serve as long-lived quantum memories, and superconducting elements can rapidly process information encoded in their quantum states. A central goal of the envisaged quantum technologies is to develop devices that can simultaneously perform several of these tasks, namely, reliably store, process, and transmit quantum information. Hybrid quantum systems composed of different physical components with complementary functionalities may provide precisely such multitasking capabilities. This article reviews some of the driving theoretical ideas and first experimental realizations of hybrid quantum systems and the opportunities and challenges they present and offers a glance at the near- and long-term perspectives of this fascinating and rapidly expanding field.},

Quantum trajectory theory accounts for the expectation values of general observables, and we use experimental data to show how a homodyne detection signal is conditioned upon both the initial state and the finally projected state of a decaying qubit. We observe, in particular, how anomalous weak values occur in continuous weak measurement for certain pre- and post-selected states. Subject to homodyne detection, the density matrix evolves in a stochastic manner, but it is restricted to a specific surface in the Bloch sphere. We show that a similar restriction applies to the information associated with the post-selection, and thus bounds the predictions of the theory.},

abstract = {We consider evolution of a double quantum dot (DQD) two-electron spin qubit which is continuously weakly measured with a linear charge detector (quantum point contact). Since the interaction between the spins of two electrons depends on their charge state, the charge measurement affects the state of two spins, and induces non-trivial spin dynamics. We consider the regimes of strong and weak coupling to the detector, and investigate the measurement-induced spin dynamics both analytically and numerically. We observe emergence of the negative-result evolution and the system stabilization due to an analog of quantum Zeno effect. Moreover, unitary evolution between the triplet and a singlet state is induced by the negative-result measurement. We demonstrate that these effects exist for both strong and weak coupling between the detector and the DQD system.},

abstract = {We propose an experiment which demonstrates the undoing of a weak continuous measurement of a solid-state qubit, so that any unknown initial state is fully restored. The undoing procedure has only a finite probability of success because of the nonunitary nature of quantum measurement, though it is accompanied by a clear experimental indication of whether or not the undoing has been successful. The probability of success decreases with increasing strength of the measurement, reaching zero for a traditional projective measurement. Measurement undoing ("quantum undemolition") may be interpreted as a kind of quantum eraser, in which the information obtained from the first measurement is erased by the second measurement, which is an essential part of the undoing procedure. The experiment can be realized using quantum dot (charge) or superconducting (phase) qubits.},

abstract = {The stochastic evolution of quantum systems during measurement is arguably the most enigmatic feature of quantum mechanics. Measuring a quantum system typically steers it towards a classical state, destroying the coherence of an initial quantum superposition and the entanglement with other quantum systems. Remarkably, the measurement of a shared property between non-interacting quan-tum systems can generate entanglement, starting from an uncorre-lated state. Of special interest in quantum computing is the parity measurement 1 , which projects the state of multiple qubits (quantum bits) to a state with an even or odd number of excited qubits. A parity meter must discern the two qubit-excitation parities with high fidelity while preserving coherence between same-parity states. Despite nume-rous proposals for atomic 2 , semiconducting 1,3–7 and superconduct-ing qubits 8,9 , realizing a parity meter that creates entanglement for both even and odd measurement results has remained an outstand-ing challenge.

Depending on the qubit design, dielectric loss from insulating materials or the tunnel junction can lead to short coherence times.

Our results demonstrate that this loss can be significantly reduced by using better dielectrics and fabricating junctions of small area less than or similar to 10 mu m(2).

@article{Murch2013,
abstract = {Quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic vacuum are responsible for physical effects such as the Casimir force and the radiative decay of atoms, and set fundamental limits on the sensitivity of measurements. Entanglement between photons can produce correlations that result in a reduction of these fluctuations below the ordinary vacuum level, allowing measurements that surpass the standard quantum limit in sensitivity. The effects of such 'squeezed states' of light on matter were first considered in a prediction of the radiative decay rates of atoms in squeezed vacuum. Despite efforts to demonstrate such effects in experiments with natural atoms, a direct quantitative observation of this prediction has remained elusive. Here we report a twofold reduction of the transverse radiative decay rate of a superconducting artificial atom coupled to continuum squeezed vacuum. The artificial atom is effectively a two-level system formed by the strong interaction between a superconducting circuit and a microwave-frequency cavity. A Josephson parametric amplifier is used to generate quadrature-squeezed electromagnetic vacuum. The observed twofold reduction in the decay rate of the atom allows the transverse coherence time, T2, to exceed the ordinary vacuum decay limit, 2T1. We demonstrate that the measured radiative decay dynamics can be used to reconstruct the Wigner distribution of the itinerant squeezed state. Our results confirm a canonical prediction of quantum optics and should enable new studies of the quantum light-matter interaction.},

abstract = {There are two general requirements to harness the computational power of quantum mechanics: the ability to manipulate the evolution of an isolated system and the ability to faithfully extract information from it. Quantum error correction and simulation often make a more exacting demand: the ability to perform non-destructive measurements of specific correlations within that system. We realize such measurements by employing a protocol adapted from [S. Nigg and S. M. Girvin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 243604 (2013)], enabling real-time selection of arbitrary register-wide Pauli operators. Our implementation consists of a simple circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) module of four highly-coherent 3D transmon qubits, collectively coupled to a high-Q superconducting microwave cavity. As a demonstration, we enact all seven nontrivial subset-parity measurements on our three-qubit register. For each we fully characterize the realized measurement by analyzing the detector (observable operators) via quantum detector tomography and by analyzing the quantum back-action via conditioned process tomography. No single quantity completely encapsulates the performance of a measurement, and standard figures of merit have not yet emerged. Accordingly, we consider several new fidelity measures for both the detector and the complete measurement process. We measure all of these quantities and report high fidelities, indicating that we are measuring the desired quantities precisely and that the measurements are highly non-demolition. We further show that both results are improved significantly by an additional error-heralding measurement. The analyses presented here form a useful basis for the future characterization and validation of quantum measurements, anticipating the demands of emerging quantum technologies.},

abstract = {The irreversible evolution of a microscopic system under measurement is a central feature of quantum theory. From an initial state generally exhibiting quantum uncertainty in the measured observable, the system is projected into a state in which this observable becomes precisely known. Its value is random, with a probability determined by the initial system's state. The evolution induced by measurement (known as 'state collapse') can be progressive, accumulating the effects of elementary state changes. Here we report the observation of such a step-by-step collapse by non-destructively measuring the photon number of a field stored in a cavity. Atoms behaving as microscopic clocks cross the cavity successively. By measuring the light-induced alterations of the clock rate, information is progressively extracted, until the initially uncertain photon number converges to an integer. The suppression of the photon number spread is demonstrated by correlations between repeated measurements. The procedure illustrates all the postulates of quantum measurement (state collapse, statistical results and repeatability) and should facilitate studies of non-classical fields trapped in cavities.},

abstract = {Initialization and read-out of coupled quantum systems are essential ingredients for the implementation of quantum algorithms. Single-shot read-out of the state of a multi-quantum-bit (multi-qubit) register would allow direct investigation of quantum correlations (entanglement), and would give access to further key resources such as quantum error correction and deterministic quantum teleportation. Although spins in solids are attractive candidates for scalable quantum information processing, their single-shot detection has been achieved only for isolated qubits. Here we demonstrate the preparation and measurement of a multi-spin quantum register in a low-temperature solid-state system by implementing resonant optical excitation techniques originally developed in atomic physics. We achieve high-fidelity read-out of the electronic spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond, and use this read-out to project up to three nearby nuclear spin qubits onto a well-defined state. Conversely, we can distinguish the state of the nuclear spins in a single shot by mapping it onto, and subsequently measuring, the electronic spin. Finally, we show compatibility with qubit control: we demonstrate initialization, coherent manipulation and single-shot read-out in a single experiment on a two-qubit register, using techniques suitable for extension to larger registers. These results pave the way for a test of Bell's inequalities on solid-state spins and the implementation of measurement-based quantum information protocols.},

abstract = {We present an extensive experimental and theoretical study of the proximity effect in InAs nanowires connected to superconducting electrodes. We fabricated and investigated devices with suspended gate controlled nanowires and non-suspended nanowires, with a broad range of lengths and normal state resistances. We analyze the main features of the current-voltage characteristics: the Josephson current, excess current, and subgap current as functions of length, temperature, magnetic field and gate voltage, and compare them with theory. The Josephson critical current for a short length device, {\$}L=30{\$} nm, exhibits a record high magnitude of {\$}800{\$}$\backslash$,nA at low temperature that comes close to the theoretically expected value. The critical current in all other devices is typically reduced compared to the theoretical values. The excess current is consistent with the normal resistance data and agrees well with the theory. The subgap current shows large number of structures, some of them are identified as subharmonic gap structures generated by Multiple Andreev Reflection. The other structures, detected in both suspended and non-suspended devices, have the form of voltage steps at voltages that are independent of either superconducting gap or length of the wire. By varying the gate voltage in suspended devices we are able to observe a cross over from typical tunneling transport at large negative gate voltage, with suppressed subgap current and negative excess current, to pronounced proximity junction behavior at large positive gate voltage, with enhanced Josephson current and subgap conductance as well as a large positive excess current.},

Here, we report an experiment on a superconducting qubit where we retrieve part of the lost information in both of these channels. We demonstrate that raw averaging the corresponding measurement records provides a full quantum tomography of the qubit state where all three components of the effective spin-1/2 are simultaneously measured. From single realizations of the experiment, it is possible to infer the quantum trajectories followed by the qubit state conditioned on relaxation and/or dephasing channels. The incompatibility between these quantum measurements of the qubit leads to observable consequences in the statistics of quantum states. The high level of controllability of superconducting circuits enables us to explore many regimes from the Zeno effect to underdamped Rabi oscillations depending on the relative strengths of driving, dephasing and relaxation.},

Because of the unique optically-induced electric and magnetic Mie resonances, high-index nanoscale structures are expected to complement or even replace different plasmonic components in a range of potential applications. Here we study strong coupling between modes of a single subwavelength high-index dielectric resonator and analyse the mode transformation and Fano resonances when resonator's aspect ratio varies. We demonstrate that strong mode coupling results in resonances with high quality factors, which are related to the physics of bound states in the continuum when the radiative losses are almost suppressed due to the Friedrich-Wintgen scenario of destructive interference. We reveal a fundamental link between the formation of the high-quality resonances and peculiarities of the Fano parameter in the scattering cross-section spectra. Our theoretical findings are confirmed by microwave experiments for the scattering of a high-index cylindrical resonators with a tunable aspect ratio. The proposed mechanism of the strong mode coupling in single subwavelength high-index resonators accompanied by resonances with high quality factor helps to extend substantially functionalities of all-dielectric nanophotonics that opens new horizons for active and passive nanoscale metadevices.},

abstract = {With the increase of complexity and coherence of superconducting systems made using the principles of circuit quantum electrodynamics, more accurate methods are needed for the characterization, analysis and optimization of these quantum processors. Here we introduce a new method of modeling that can be applied to superconducting structures involving multiple Josephson junctions, high-Q superconducting cavities, external ports, and voltage sources. Our technique, an extension of our previous work on single-port structures (Solgun, 2014), permits the derivation of system Hamiltonians that are capable of representing every feature of the physical system over a wide frequency band and the computation of T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}1{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} times for qubits. We begin with a "black box" model of the linear and passive part of the system. Its response is given by its multiport impedance function Z{\textless}inf{\textgreater}sim{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}(??), which can be obtained using a finite-element electromagnetics simulator. The ports of this black box are defined by the terminal pairs of Josephson junctions, voltage sources, and 50?? connectors to high-frequency lines. We fit Z{\textless}inf{\textgreater}sim{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}(??) to a positive-real (PR) multiport impedance matrix Z(s), a function of the complex Laplace variable s. We then use state-space techniques to synthesize a finite electric circuit admitting exactly the same impedance Z(s) across its ports; the PR property ensures the existence of this finite physical circuit. We compare the performance of state-space algorithms to classical frequency domain methods, justifying their superiority in numerical stability. The Hamiltonian of the multiport model circuit is obtained by using existing lumped element circuit quantization formalisms (Burkard et al., 2004; Burkard, 2005). Due to the presence of ideal transformers in the model circuit, these quantization methods must be extended, requiring the introduction of an extension of the Kirchhoff voltage and current laws.},

abstract = {Two-photon loss mechanisms often accompany a Kerr nonlinearity. The kinetic inductance exhibited by superconducting transmission lines provides an example of a Kerr-like nonlinearity that is accompanied by a nonlinear resistance of the two-photon absorptive type. Such nonlinear dissipation can degrade the performance of amplifiers and mixers employing a Kerr-like nonlinearity as the gain or mixing medium. As an aid for parametric-amplifier design, the authors provide a quantum analysis of a cavity parametric amplifier employing a Kerr nonlinearity that is accompanied by a two-photon absorptive loss. Because of their usefulness in diagnostics, we obtain expressions for the pump amplitude within the cavity, the reflection coefficient for the pump amplitude reflected off of the cavity, the parametric gain, and the intermodulation gain. Expressions by which the degree of squeezing can be computed are also presented. Although the focus here is on providing aids for the design of kinetic-inductance parametric amplifiers, much of what is presented is directly applicable to analogous optical and mechanical amplifiers},

abstract = {Dynamical systems, whether classical or quantum, usually require a method to stabilize performance and maintain the required state. For instance, communication between computers requires error correction codes to ensure that information is transferred correctly. In a quantum system, however, the very act of measuring it can perturb it. Leghtas et al. show that engineering the interaction between a quantum system and its environment can induce stability for the delicate quantum states, a process that could simplify quantum information processing.Science, this issue p. 853 Physical systems usually exhibit quantum behavior, such as superpositions and entanglement, only when they are sufficiently decoupled from a lossy environment. Paradoxically, a specially engineered interaction with the environment can become a resource for the generation and protection of quantum states. This notion can be generalized to the confinement of a system into a manifold of quantum states, consisting of all coherent superpositions of multiple stable steady states. We have confined the state of a superconducting resonator to the quantum manifold spanned by two coherent states of opposite phases and have observed a Schr{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}dinger cat state spontaneously squeeze out of vacuum before decaying into a classical mixture. This experiment points toward robustly encoding quantum information in multidimensional steady-state manifolds.},

@article{Sandberg2012,
abstract = {The structural and electrical properties of Ti-N films deposited by reactive sputtering depend on their growth parameters, in particular the Ar:N2 gas ratio. We show that the nitrogen percentage changes the crystallographic phase of the film progressively from pure $\backslash$alpha-Ti, through an $\backslash$alpha-Ti phase with interstitial nitrogen, to stoichiometric Ti2N, and through a substoichiometric TiNX to stoichiometric TiN. These changes also affect the superconducting transition temperature, Tc, allowing, the superconducting properties to be tailored for specific applications. After decreasing from a Tc of 0.4 K for pure Ti down to below 50 mK at the Ti2N point, the Tc then increases rapidly up to nearly 5 K over a narrow range of nitrogen incorporation. This very sharp increase of Tc makes it difficult to control the properties of the film from wafer-to-wafer as well as across a given wafer to within acceptable margins for device fabrication. Here we show that the nitrogen composition and hence the superconductive properties are related to, and can be determined by, spectroscopic ellipsometry. Therefore, this technique may be used for process control and wafer screening prior to investing time in processing devices.},

abstract = {With the publication in 1994 of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Science: An Investment in the Future (the FAMOS report), the National Research Council launched the series Physics in a New Era, its latest survey of physics. Each of the six area volumes in the survey focuses on a different subfield of physics, describing advances since the last decadal survey and suggesting future opportunities and directions. This survey culminated in 2001 with the publication of the seventh and final volume, Physics in a New Era: An Overview. Since the publication of the FAMOS report, the developments in atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) science have been amazing.$\backslash$nSignificant advances in areas such as cooling and trapping, atom and quantum optics, single-atom and single-molecule detection, and ultrafast and ultra intense phenomena, along with the emergence of new applications, made it clear that an update of the FAMOS report was needed. With support from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, the Committee for an Updated Assessment of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Science was formed. The committee's statement of task reads as follows: The committee will prepare a narrative document that portrays the advances in AMO science and its impact on society. This report highlights selected forefront areas of AMO science, emphasizing recent accomplishments and new opportunities, identifies connections between AMO science and other scientific fields, emerging technologies, and national needs, describes career opportunities for AMO scientists.$\backslash$nTo accomplish its task and at the same time reach a broad audience, the committee decided to present its report in the form of a brochure highlighting selected advances, connections, and impacts on national needs. An exhaustive assessment of the field, which will fall within the purview of the next decadal survey, was not the goal of the update. The committee would like to express its gratitude for the informative interactions it had with many scientists and policy makers. Many colleagues completed a questionnaire and suggested topics to be included in this report. The final selection of topics was made in accordance with the criteria set forth in the statement of task. While this report was still being written, the tragic events of September 11, 2001, occurred. AMO science and its applications have already played and will continue to play a central role in our nation's response to terrorist threats from conventional as well as chemical or biological weapons. Some of the technology discussed in this report in the chapter {\"{A}}MO Science Enhancing National Defense$\backslash$" was used successfully for the U.S. military response in Afghanistan$\backslash$u2014the Global Positioning System (GPS) and laser-guided munitions are just two examples.

We present autonomous entanglement stabilization protocols between two qubits that are coupled to distant cavities. The cavities coupling is mediated and controlled via a three-wave mixing device that generates either a delocalized mode or a two-mode squeezed state between the remote cavities depending on the pump frequency. Local drives on the qubits and the cavities steer and maintain the system to the desired qubit Bell state. Most spectacularly, even a weakly-squeezed state can stabilize a maximally entangled Bell state of two distant qubits through entanglement accumulation. We show that reservoir-engineering based protocols can stabilize entanglement in presence of qubit-cavity asymmetries and losses.},

abstract = {The state of a microscopic system encodes its complete quantum description, from which the probabilities of all measurement outcomes are inferred. Being a statistical concept, the state cannot be obtained from a single system realization, but can instead be reconstructed from an ensemble of copies through measurements on different realizations. Reconstructing the state of a set of trapped particles shielded from their environment is an important step in the investigation of the quantum-classical boundary. Although trapped-atom state reconstructions have been achieved, it is challenging to perform similar experiments with trapped photons because cavities that can store light for very long times are required. Here we report the complete reconstruction and pictorial representation of a variety of radiation states trapped in a cavity in which several photons survive long enough to be repeatedly measured. Atoms crossing the cavity one by one are used to extract information about the field. We obtain images of coherent states, Fock states with a definite photon number and 'Schr{\"{o}}dinger cat' states (superpositions of coherent states with different phases). These states are equivalently represented by their density matrices or Wigner functions. Quasi-classical coherent states have a Gaussian-shaped Wigner function, whereas the Wigner functions of Fock and Schr{\"{o}}dinger cat states show oscillations and negativities revealing quantum interferences. Cavity damping induces decoherence that quickly washes out such oscillations. We observe this process and follow the evolution of decoherence by reconstructing snapshots of Schr{\"{o}}dinger cat states at successive times. Our reconstruction procedure is a useful tool for further decoherence and quantum feedback studies of fields trapped in one or two cavities.},

We demonstrate a novel superconducting microwave cavity architecture that is highly robust against major sources of loss that are encountered in the engineering of circuit QED systems. The architecture allows for near-millisecond storage of quantum states in a resonator while strong coupling between the resonator and a transmon qubit enables control, encoding, and readout at MHz rates. The observed coherence times constitute an improvement of almost an order of magnitude over those of the best available superconducting qubits. Our design is an ideal platform for studying coherent quantum optics and marks an important step towards hardware-efficient quantum computing with Josephson junction-based quantum circuits.},

These interactions are a fundamental building block for quantum optics, bringing many-body physics to the photonic world and providing important resources for quantum photonic devices and for optical metrology. In this Colloquium, we review the physics of strongly-interacting photons in one-dimensional systems with no optical confinement along the propagation direction. We focus on two recently-demonstrated experimental realizations: superconducting qubits coupled to open transmission lines, and interacting Rydberg atoms in a cold gas. Advancements in the theoretical understanding of these systems are presented in complementary formalisms and compared to experimental results. The experimental achievements are summarized alongside a description of the quantum optical effects and quantum devices emerging from them.},

We focus on paths that increase in energy during the continuous measurement. Our results are compared to Monte Carlo numerical simulation of the trajectories, and we find close agreement between direct simulation and theory.

Such a ?Bell's inequality in time?, which should be violated by a quantum TLS, is tested here. In this work, the TLS is a superconducting quantum circuit whose Rabi oscillations are continuously driven while it is continuously and weakly measured.

If the spatial modulation is introduced by varying the junction areas, we find that the best result is obtained for a spatially homogeneous chain, reported earlier in the literature. An improvement over the homogeneous result can be obtained by representing the junctions by SQUIDs with different loop areas, so the inductances can be varied by applying a magnetic field. Still, we find that this improvement becomes less important for longer chains.},

abstract = {We analyze the Purcell relaxation rate of a superconducting qubit coupled to a resonator, which is coupled to a transmission line and pumped by an external microwave drive. Considering the typical regime of the qubit measurement, we focus on the case when the qubit frequency is significantly detuned from the resonator frequency. Surprisingly, the Purcell rate decreases when the strength of the microwave drive is increased. This suppression becomes significant in the nonlinear regime. In the presence of the microwave drive, the loss of photons to the transmission line also causes excitation of the qubit; however, the excitation rate is typically much smaller than the relaxation rate. Our analysis also applies to a more general case of a two-level quantum system coupled to a cavity.},

abstract = {It is shown that the evolution of an open quantum system whose density operator obeys a Markovian master equation can in some cases be meaningfully described in terms of stochastic Schr{\"{o}}dinger equations (SSE's) for its state vector. A necessary condition for this is that the information carried away from the system by the bath (source of the irreversibility) be recoverable. The primary field of application is quantum optics, where the bath consists of the continuum of electromagnetic modes. The information lost from the system can be recovered using a perfect photodetector. The state of the system conditioned on the photodetections undergoes stochastic quantum jumps. Alternative measurement schemes on the outgoing light (homodyne and heterodyne detection) are shown to give rise to SSE's with diffusive terms. These three detection schemes are illustrated on a simple quantum system, the two-level atom, giving new perspectives on the interpretation of measurement results. The reality of these and other stochastic processes for state vectors is discussed.},

This architecture is attractive both as a macroscopic analog of atomic physics experiments and for quantum computing and control, since it provides strong inhibition of spontaneous emission, potentially leading to greatly enhanced qubit lifetimes, allows high-fidelity quantum non-demolition measurements of the state of multiple qubits, and has a natural mechanism for entanglement of qubits separated by centimeter distances.

The resolution of this paradox required the insight that an intimate relationship exists between information and thermodynamics. Here, we realize a Maxwell demon experiment that tracks the state of each constituent in both the classical and quantum regimes. The demon is a microwave cavity that encodes quantum information about a superconducting qubit and converts information into work by powering up a propagating microwave pulse by stimulated emission.

In these devices, ultra-low loss titanium nitride was progressively replaced with aluminum in the inter-digitated capacitor and meandered inductor elements. By measuring the power dependent loss at 50 mK as the Al-TiN fraction in each element is increased, we find that at low electric field, i.e. in the single photon limit, the loss is two level system in nature and is correlated with the amount of Al capacitance rather than the Al inductance. In the high electric field limit, the remaining loss is linearly related to the product of the Al area times its inductance and is likely due to quasiparticles generated by stray radiation. At elevated temperature, additional loss is correlated with the amount of Al in the inductance, with a power independent TiN-Al interface loss term that exponentially decreases as the temperature is reduced. The TiN-Al interface loss is vanishingly small at the 50 mK base temperature.},

abstract = {Superconducting circuits are one of the leading quantum platforms for quantum technologies. With growing system complexity, it is of crucial importance to develop scalable circuit models that contain the minimum information required to predict the behaviour of the physical system. Based on microwave engineering methods, divergent and non-divergent Hamiltonian models in circuit quantum electrodynamics have been proposed to explain the dynamics of superconducting quantum networks coupled to infinite-dimensional systems, such as transmission lines and general impedance environments. Here, we study systematically common linear coupling configurations between networks and infinite-dimensional systems. The main result is that the simple Lagrangian models for these configurations present an intrinsic natural length that provides a natural ultraviolet cutoff. This length is due to the unavoidable dressing of the environment modes by the network. In this manner, the coupling parameters between their components correctly manifest their natural decoupling at high frequencies. Furthermore, we show the requirements to correctly separate infinite-dimensional coupled systems in local bases. We also compare our analytical results with other analytical and approximate methods available in the literature. Finally, we propose several applications of these general methods to analog quantum simulation of multi-spin-boson models in non-perturbative coupling regimes.},

@article{Campagne2016-Fluorescence,
abstract = {A qubit can relax by fluorescence, which prompts the release of a photon into its electromagnetic environment. By counting the emitted photons, discrete quantum jumps of the qubit state can be observed. The succession of states occupied by the qubit in a single experiment, its quantum trajectory, depends in fact on the kind of detector. How are the quantum trajectories modified if one measures continuously the amplitude of the fluorescence field instead? Using a superconducting parametric amplifier, we have performed heterodyne detection of the fluorescence of a superconducting qubit. For each realization of the measurement record, we can reconstruct a different quantum trajectory for the qubit. The observed evolution obeys quantum state diffusion, which is characteristic of quantum measurements subject to zero point fluctuations. Independent projective measurements of the qubit at various times provide a quantitative validation of the reconstructed trajectories. By exploring the statistics of quantum trajectories, we demonstrate that the qubit states span a deterministic surface in the Bloch sphere at each time in the evolution. Additionally, we show that when monitoring fluorescence, coherent superpositions are generated during the decay from excited to ground state. Counterintuitively, measuring light emitted during relaxation can give rise to trajectories with increased excitation probability.},

@article{Parra-Rodriguez2018,
abstract = {Non-reciprocal devices effectively mimic the breaking of time-reversal symmetry for the subspace of dynamical variables that it couples, and they can be used to create chiral information processing networks. We study how to systematically include ideal gyrators and circulators into Lagrangian and Hamiltonian descriptions of lumped-element electrical networks. The proposed theory is of wide applicability in general non-reciprocal networks on the quantum regime. We apply it to useful and pedagogical examples of circuits containing Josephson junctions and non-reciprocal ideal elements described by admittance matrices, and compare it with the more involved treatment of circuits based on non-reciprocal devices characterized by impedance and/or scattering matrices. Finally, we discuss the dual quantization of circuits containing phase-slip junctions and non-reciprocal devices.},
