\noindent
Haskell Curry may be surprised to hear that he has spent a lifetime doing fundamental work in category theory. The purpose of this account is to convince categorists that Cartesian closed categories (Eilenberg and Kelly, 1966) have been anticipated by logicians (Curry, 1930) by many years and, conversely, to per­ suade logicians that combinatory logic may benefit from being phrased in categorical language.

I have attempted to tell this story twice before (1972, 1974), but am not entirely satisfied with these earlier accounts. The present exposition is essentially my unscheduled talk at the 1977 Durham Symposium on applications of sheaf theory to logic, algebra and analysis.

I regret that limitations of space do not permit a discus­ sion of illative combinatory logic (Curry and Feys, 1958) or combinatory type theory (Church, 1940) and applications thereof to the construction of free toposes.

Let me confess at once that I am not a historical scholar
and that I have taken some liberties with the original material. Thus, I have taken the opportunity to present the early discov­eries of combinatory logic in the language of universal algebra.

Our story begins in 1924, when \schon\ studied what would now be called an algebra $A = (|A|, \app, \cI, \cS, \cK)$ consisting of
a set $|A|$ equipped with a binary operation $\app$
and constants $\cI$, $\cS$ and $\cK$. These were to satisfy the following identities:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] $\cI \app a = a$,

\item[(2)] $(\cK \app a) \app b = a$,

\item[(3)] $((\cS \app f) \app g) \app c = (f \app c) \app\, (g \app c)$,%
\footnote{Editor's note: Lambek uses this squiggle $\app$ to denote a binary operation for function application. It appears here and in his later book about this same subject. I made a best guess about how to translate this into \LaTeX.}

\end{enumerate}


\noindent
for all elements $a$, $b$, $c$, $f$ and $g$ of $|A|$.
Actually, \schon\ did not employ the language of universal algebra, and he defined $\cI$ in terms of $\cK$ and $\cS$, but of this we shall speak later. His main result would now be stated as follows.

\begin{prop}
Every polynomial $\varphi(x)$ over a \schon\ algebra $A$ can be written in the form $f \app x$, where $f \in |A|$.
\end{prop}
Polynomials are of course formed as words in an indetermi­nate $x$ and are subject to the same three identities. More pre­cisely, equality $\underrel{x}{=}$ between polynomials is the smallest equi­valence relation $\equiv$ between words in $x$ which has the substitution property

\be
\inferrule {\varphi(x) \equiv \psi(x) \qquad \alpha(x) \equiv \beta(x)}{\varphi(x) \app \alpha(x) \equiv \psi(x) \app \beta(x)}
 \tag{$0_{X}$} \\
\ee
and which satisfies
