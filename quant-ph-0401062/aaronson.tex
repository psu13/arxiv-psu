\begin{abstract}
This recreational paper investigates what happens if we change quantum
mechanics in several ways. \ The main results are as follows. \ First, if we
replace the $2$-norm by some other $p$-norm, then there are no nontrivial
norm-preserving linear maps. \ Second, if we relax the demand that norm be
preserved, we end up with a theory that allows rapid solution of $\mathsf{PP}%
$-complete problems (as well as superluminal signalling). \ And third, if we
restrict amplitudes to be real, we run into a difficulty much simpler than the
usual one based on parameter-counting of mixed states.

\section{Introduction\label{INTRO}}

\begin{quote}
``It is striking that it has so far not been possible to find a logically
consistent theory that is close to quantum mechanics, other than quantum
mechanics itself.''\ ---Steven Weinberg, \textit{Dreams of a Final Theory} \cite{weinberg2}
\end{quote}

The title of this paper should be self-explanatory, but if it isn't:
\textquotedblleft theoryspace\textquotedblright\ is the space of logically
conceivable physical theories, with two theories close to each other if they
differ in few respects. \ An \textquotedblleft island\textquotedblright\ in
theoryspace is a natural and interesting theory, whose neighbors are all
somehow perverse or degenerate.\footnote{A bit of pedantry: a physicist might
call the neighbors of quantum mechanics I'll discuss \textquotedblleft
inconsistent,\textquotedblright\ since they contradict auxiliary assumptions
that the physicist considers obvious. \ I'll stick to milder epithets like
\textquotedblleft perverse.\textquotedblright} \ The Standard Model isn't an
island, because we don't know any compelling (non-anthropic) reason why the
masses and coupling constants should have the values they do.\footnote{More
pedantry: whether a theory is an island is therefore a function of our
knowledge, not just of the theory itself.} \ Likewise, general relativity is
probably not an island, because of alternatives such as the Brans-Dicke theory.

To many physicists, however, quantum mechanics \textit{does} seem like an
island: change any one aspect, and the whole structure collapses. \ This view
is buttressed by three types of results:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] \textbf{\textquotedblleft Derivations\textquotedblright\ of the
}$\left\vert \mathbf{\psi}\right\vert ^{2}$\textbf{ probability rule.}
\ Gleason's Theorem \cite{gleason}\ shows that, in a Hilbert space of dimension
$3$ or higher, the usual quantum probability rule is the only one consistent
with a requirement of noncontextuality. \ Deutsch \cite{deutsch} and
Zurek \cite{zurek} derived the rule from other assumptions.

\item[(2)] \textbf{Arguments for complex amplitudes.} \ If $f(  n)
$\ is the number of real parameters needed to specify an $n$-dimensional mixed
state, then only when amplitudes are complex numbers does $f(  n_{A}%
n_{B})  =f(  n_{A})  f(  n_{B})  $\ (since
$f(  n)  =n^{2}$). \ With real amplitudes, $f(  n)
=n(  n+1)  /2$\ and thus $f(  n_{A}n_{B})  >f(
n_{A})  f(  n_{B})  $. \ With quaternionic amplitudes,
$f(  n)  =2n^{2}-n$\ and thus $f(  n_{A}n_{B})
<f(  n_{A})  f(  n_{B})  $. \ Caves, Fuchs, and
Schack \cite{cfs} exploited this observation to show that a \textquotedblleft
quantum de Finetti Theorem\textquotedblright\ (which justifies Bayesian
reasoning) works only if amplitudes are complex.\ \ Hardy \cite{hardy} also
made essential use of the observation in his derivation of quantum mechanics
from \textquotedblleft five simple axioms.\textquotedblright

\item[(3)] \textquotedblleft\textbf{Perverse\textquotedblright\ consequences
of nonlinearity.} \ After Weinberg \cite{weinberg}\ proposed nonlinear variants
of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, Gisin \cite{gisin}\ and
Polchinski \cite{polchinski}\ independently observed that almost all such
variants would allow superluminal signalling. \ Later Abrams and
Lloyd \cite{al} argued that a \textquotedblleft nonlinear quantum
computer\textquotedblright\ could solve $\mathsf{NP}$-complete and even
$\mathsf{\#P}$-complete problems in polynomial time.\footnote{Abrams and Lloyd
claimed furthermore that their nonlinear algorithms are robust against small
errors. \ This claim does not withstand detailed scrutiny; whether nonlinear
quantum computers can solve $\mathsf{NP}$- and $\mathsf{\#P}$-complete
problems robustly therefore remains an intriguing open problem. \ On the other
hand, if arbitrary $1$-qubit nonlinear gates can be implemented without error,
then even $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-complete problems can be solved in polynomial
time. \ This result is tight, since nonlinear quantum computers can also be
simulated in $\mathsf{PSPACE}$. \ These claims will be proved in another paper.}
\end{enumerate}

This paper won't attempt another axiomatic derivation like that of
Hardy \cite{hardy}---its more modest goal is just to stroll through quantum
mechanics' neighborhood of theoryspace. \ All mathematical results in this
paper are trivial. \ So why write it then? \ Apart from the fact that
triviality never stopped a quantum philosopher before, I hope to make a point:
that if you change quantum mechanics in the most obvious ways, you'll run into
problems that have nothing to do with the subtleties of\ contextuality,
locality, or entanglement. \ Even in \textquotedblleft quantum mechanics
lite\textquotedblright---where there are no mixed states, no tensor products,
and no intermediate measurements, just vectors representing probabilities that
get mapped to other vectors---you'll need to worry about conservation of
probability, and about closure properties of the allowed vector maps.

I \textit{won't} make this point regarding nonlinear quantum mechanics, for
the simple reason that there it seems false. \ Contrary to what I originally
thought, one can define a large, natural class of discrete norm-preserving
nonlinear gates. \ This class includes \textquotedblleft Weinberg
gates\textquotedblright\ such as%
\[
W\left(
\begin{array}
[c]{c}%
x\\
y
\end{array}
\right)  =\left(
\begin{array}
[c]{c}%
x\\
e^{iy}y
\end{array}
\right)  ,
\]
as well as \textquotedblleft polynomial gates\textquotedblright\ such as%
\[
G\left(
\begin{array}
[c]{c}%
x\\
y
\end{array}
\right)  =\left(
\begin{array}
[c]{c}%
x^{2}-\left(  y^{\ast}\right)  ^{2}\\
2\operatorname{Re}xy
\end{array}
\right)  .
\]
Since $\left\Vert G\left(  v\right)  \right\Vert _{2}=\left\Vert v\right\Vert
_{2}^{2}$, the gate $G$ preserves the $2$-norm of $v$ provided $\left\Vert
v\right\Vert _{2}=1$. \ As far as I can tell, any argument for the
implausibility of $W$ or $G$ needs to be based on \textit{physical} effects,
such as superluminal signalling or efficient solubility of $\mathsf{NP}%
$-complete problems.

The paper is (not very well) organized as follows. \ Section \ref{PNORM}%
\ shows that when $p\neq2$, the only $p$-norm-preserving linear
transformations are permutations of diagonal matrices. \ In other words, if
you want to base quantum mechanics on a $p$-norm other than the $2$-norm, then
you'll need to include some sort of \textquotedblleft manual
normalization.\textquotedblright\ \ However, manual normalization brings with
it most of the hazards of nonlinearity: superluminal signalling,
distinguishability of non-orthogonal states, and polynomial-time solubility of
\textquotedblleft obviously hard\textquotedblright
\ problems.\footnote{$\mathsf{NP}$-complete problems are obviously hard;
factoring and graph isomorphism are not.} \ Section \ref{POSTBQP} addresses
the last point in detail, by using the concept of \textit{postselection} to
study the computational power of alternative quantum theories. The
punchline, which might be of independent interest to computer scientists, is
that all the alternative theories considered have at least the power of the
complexity class $\mathsf{PP}$,\footnote{See www.cs.berkeley.edu/\symbol{126}%
aaronson/zoo.html for definitions of over $370$ complexity classes.} and many
have \textit{exactly} the power of $\mathsf{PP}$.

Finally, Section \ref{REAL}\ gives an argument for why amplitudes are complex
rather than real, that has nothing to do with the parameter-counting arguments
of Refs. \cite{cfr,cfs,hardy}. \ Unfortunately, my argument says nothing about
why amplitudes are complex rather than quaternionic.

\section{Other $p$-Norms\label{PNORM}}

\begin{quote}
\textquotedblleft Addition in proof: More careful considerations show that the
probability is proportional to the square of the [amplitude] $\Phi_{nrm}%
$.\textquotedblright\ ---Max Born \cite{born}, in a footnote to his 1926 paper
introducing the probability interpretation (the main text says the probability
is proportional to $\Phi_{nrm}$ itself)
\end{quote}

No doubt about it: the $2$-norm is special. \ The Pythagorean Theorem,
Fermat's Last Theorem, and least-squares regression all involve properties of
a sum of squares that fail for a sum of cubes or of any other power.\ \ Still,
given that classical probability theory is based on the $1$-norm and quantum
mechanics on the $2$-norm, it's natural to wonder what singles out $1$ and
$2$. \ What happens if we try to base a theory on the $p$-norm\footnote{The
main reason for restricting attention to $p$-norms is their behavior under
tensor products: disregarding zany functions that depend on the Axiom of
Choice, if $f\left(  \alpha\beta\right)  =f\left(  \alpha\right)  f\left(
\beta\right)  $\ for all $\alpha,\beta$\ then $f\left(  \alpha\right)  $ must
have the form $\left\vert \alpha\right\vert ^{p}$. \ However, it might be
interesting to consider theories where the probability of measuring a basis
state $\left\vert x\right\rangle $\ depends on \textit{all} amplitudes, not
just that of $\left\vert x\right\rangle $.} for some other $p$? \ In this
section I'll explain why the $2$-norm is the only $p$-norm that permits
nontrivial norm-preserving linear maps.\footnote{When $p=0$\ all linear maps
are norm-preserving, but they have no effect because all outcomes of a
measurement are always equiprobable. \ When $p=\infty$\ only generalized
diagonal matrices are norm-preserving, as in the case $2<p<\infty$. \ I refuse
even to discuss the case $p<0$.}

It's easiest to start with real amplitudes and then generalize to complex
ones.\ \ We want to know which matrices $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$\ have the
property that for all vectors $x$, $\left\Vert Ax\right\Vert _{p}=\left\Vert
x\right\Vert _{p}$, where $\left\Vert \cdot\right\Vert _{p}$\ denotes the
$p$-norm. \ We can gain some intuition by counting constraints. \ When
$p=1$\ \textit{and} we restrict our attention to $x$ with nonnegative entries,
we obtain the set of stochastic matrices, or nonnegative matrices that satisfy
$n$ linear constraints. \ When $p=2$, we obtain the set of orthogonal
matrices, or those $A=\left(  a_{jk}\right)  $\ such that%
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{jk}a_{kl}=\delta_{kl} \label{orthog}%
\end{equation}
for all $k,l$. \ Equation \ref{orthog} imposes $n\left(  n+1\right)
/2$\ quadratic constraints on $A$, cutting the number of parameters needed to
specify $A$ roughly in half. \ Continuing, when $p=3$\ we expect order $n^{3}%
$\ cubic constraints, when $p=4$, order $n^{4}$\ quartic constraints, and so
on. \ That the number of constraints exceeds the number of parameters for
$p>2$\ makes us suspect that $p=2$\ is the \textquotedblleft end of the line.\textquotedblright

But that's not a rigorous argument, because we know there are matrices that
are norm-preserving for all $p$: the generalized diagonal matrices (that is,
products of permutation matrices and diagonal matrices). \ To show that these
are the only norm-preserving matrices, first let $p$ be an even integer
greater than $2$. \ Then letting $x=\left(  x_{j}\right)  $, the requirement%
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_{j}^{p}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\left(  \sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{jk}%
x_{k}\right)  ^{p} \label{porthog}%
\end{equation}
for all $x$ implies that the left- and right-hand sides are identical as
formal polynomials, and therefore (among other constraints) that%
\[
\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{jk}^{p-2}a_{jl}^{2}=\delta_{kl}%
\]
for all $k,l$. \ This in turn implies that for all $j$\ and $k\neq l$, either
$a_{jk}=0$\ or $a_{jl}=0$. \ But since every column must contain nonzero
entries by the constraint $\sum_{j}a_{jk}^{p}=1$, this implies that $A$ is a
generalized diagonal matrix.

Next let $p$ be an odd positive integer. \ We claim that, so long as
$x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}$ are nonnegative, the entries of $Ax$ never change sign.
\ Clearly there exist $s_{1},\ldots,s_{n}\in\left\{  -1,1\right\}  $\ such
that%
\[
\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_{j}^{p}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}s_{j}y_{j}^{p}%
\]
as formal polynomials, where $y_{j}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{jk}x_{k}$. \ Suppose by
contradiction that, keeping all $x_{j}$'s nonnegative, we could make
$\operatorname*{sgn}\left(  y_{j}\right)  s_{j}=-1$ for some $j$, where
$\operatorname*{sgn}\left(  y_{j}\right)  $ is $0$ if $y_{j}=0$ and$\ y_{j}%
/\left\vert y_{j}\right\vert $ otherwise. \ Then%
\[
\sum_{j=1}^{n}\operatorname*{sgn}\left(  y_{j}\right)  y_{j}^{p}=\sum
_{j=1}^{n}x_{j}^{p}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}s_{j}y_{j}^{p}%
\]
as formal polynomials, which implies that%
\[
\sum_{\operatorname*{sgn}\left(  y_{j}\right)  s_{j}=-1}\operatorname*{sgn}%
\left(  y_{j}\right)  y_{j}^{p}=0.
\]
Since every term in the above sum is nonnegative, we have $y_{j}^{p}=0$\ for
all $j$\ such that $\operatorname*{sgn}\left(  y_{j}\right)  s_{j}=-1$, which
implies that $a_{jk}=0$\ for all $j,k$\ such that $\operatorname*{sgn}\left(
y_{j}\right)  s_{j}=-1$, contradiction.

Since the entries of $Ax$\ never change sign when $x$ is nonnegative, it
follows that in each row of $A$, all entries have the same sign. \ So if we
define a new matrix $B$ by $b_{jk}=\left\vert a_{jk}\right\vert $, then $B$
also has the property that $\left\Vert Bx\right\Vert _{p}=\left\Vert
x\right\Vert _{p}$\ for all $x$. \ But then when $p\geq3$, the same reasoning
from the case of even $p$ implies that $B$ is generalized diagonal, which
implies that $A$ was generalized diagonal as well. \ When $p=1$, $B$ is
stochastic, and it is easily checked that the only stochastic matrices that
preserve the $1$-norm of all vectors (not just nonnegative ones) are
permutation matrices.

Finally, let $p>0$ be an arbitrary real that is not an integer. \ Let
$\widetilde{x}_{j}=\left\vert x_{j}\right\vert ^{p}$; then%
\[
\sum_{j=1}^{n}\widetilde{x}_{j}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\left\vert \sum_{k=1}^{n}%
a_{jk}\widetilde{x}_{k}^{1/p}\right\vert ^{p}%
\]
for all $\widetilde{x}_{1},\ldots,\widetilde{x}_{n}$. \ It follows that there
exist $s_{1},\ldots,s_{n}\in\left\{  -1,1\right\}  $\ such that%
\[
\sum_{j=1}^{n}\widetilde{x}_{j}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\left(  s_{j}\sum_{k=1}%
^{n}a_{jk}\widetilde{x}_{k}^{1/p}\right)  ^{p}%
\]
as formal functions. \ But this implies that $A$ is generalized diagonal,
since otherwise the right-hand side could never be simplified to a linear
function in the $\widetilde{x}_{j}$'s.

So much for real amplitudes. \ When we generalize to complex amplitudes
$x_{j}\in\mathbb{C}$, there are two defensible choices: letting $x_{j}%
=\alpha_{j}+i\beta_{j}$, we could require either $\sum_{j=1}^{n}\left(
\left\vert \alpha_{j}\right\vert ^{p}+\left\vert \beta_{j}\right\vert
^{p}\right)  =1$ or $\sum_{j=1}^{n}\left\vert x_{j}\right\vert ^{p}=1$, where
$\left\vert x_{j}\right\vert =\sqrt{\alpha_{j}^{2}+\beta_{j}^{2}}$ as usual.
\ Under the first choice, we can consider $\alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{n}%
,\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{n}$ as a vector of $2n$\ reals and $A$ as a
$2n\times2n$\ matrix; then the results from the real-amplitude case
immediately imply that $A$ is generalized diagonal. \ Under the second choice,
we can choose an $x_{l}\neq0$\ and replace it by $e^{i\theta}x_{l}$, holding
all other $x_{k}$'s fixed. \ Then since $\sum_{j=1}^{n}\left\vert
x_{j}\right\vert ^{p}$\ remains constant as we vary $\theta$,%
\[
\sum_{j=1}^{n}\left\vert y_{j}\right\vert ^{p}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\left\vert
a_{jl}e^{i\theta}x_{l}+\sum_{k\neq l}a_{jk}x_{k}\right\vert ^{p}%
\]
must also remain constant. \ But when $p\neq2$, this is possible only if for
all $j$, either $a_{jl}=0$\ or $\sum_{k\neq l}a_{jk}x_{k}=0$. \ Intuitively,
once we sneak the $2$-norm in \textquotedblleft through the back
door\textquotedblright\ in defining the norm of a complex number, consistency
forces us to use it everywhere. \ We omit a proof of this fact, since it
follows easily from a case analysis similar to that for real amplitudes.

Stepping back, what can we say about why the $2$-norm is special? \ The
standard answer---that the $2$-norm is special because it's preserved under
rotations---merely pushes the question from quantum mechanics back to the
Pythagorean Theorem. \ The latter might be thought a good enough place to
stop. \ However, although the Pythagorean Theorem dates back some 3800 years,
I confess to having never \textit{understood} it at a gut level. \ (Have you?)
\ So if pressed, I'd instead answer the question as follows: values of $p$
other than positive even integers are almost nonstarters, since we want
$\left\vert x\right\vert ^{p}$\ to be defined and smooth at $x=0$. \ But when
$p=4,6,8,\ldots$, Equation \ref{porthog}\ involves terms of\ the form $\left(
a_{jk}x_{k}\right)  ^{q}\left(  a_{jl}x_{l}\right)  ^{p-q}$\ where $q$ and
$p-q$ are both positive even integers, and that immediately forces $A$ to be
generalized diagonal. \ So all that's left is $p=2$.

If you still want to define quantum mechanics using a $p$-norm where $p\neq2$,
the only option seems to be \textit{manual normalization}. \ This means that
when a state $\left\vert \psi\right\rangle =\sum_{x}\alpha_{x}\left\vert
x\right\rangle $\ is measured in the standard basis, the probability of
outcome $\left\vert x\right\rangle $\ is $\left\vert \alpha_{x}\right\vert
^{p}/\sum_{y}\left\vert \alpha_{y}\right\vert ^{p}$. \ Since keeping
$\left\vert \psi\right\rangle $\ normalized is no longer imperative, three
options present themselves for how $\left\vert \psi\right\rangle $\ evolves:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] As usual, $\left\vert \psi\right\rangle $\ can be mapped to
$U\left\vert \psi\right\rangle $\ where $U$ is any unitary matrix.

\item[(ii)] $\left\vert \psi\right\rangle $\ can be mapped to $A\left\vert
\psi\right\rangle $\ where $A$ is any invertible matrix.

\item[(iii)] $\left\vert \psi\right\rangle $\ can be mapped to $A\left\vert
\psi\right\rangle $, but then \textit{local normalization} is performed on the
subsystem acted on by $A$.
\end{enumerate}

To illustrate option (iii), suppose the nonunitary gate%
\[
\left(
\begin{array}
[c]{cc}%
q & r\\
s & t
\end{array}
\right)
\]
is applied to the second qubit of the normalized state $\alpha\left|
00\right\rangle +\beta\left|  01\right\rangle +\gamma\left|  10\right\rangle
+\delta\left|  11\right\rangle $. \ Then the unnormalized result is%
\[
\left(  q\alpha+r\beta\right)  \left|  00\right\rangle +\left(  s\alpha
+t\beta\right)  \left|  01\right\rangle +\left(  q\gamma+r\delta\right)
\left|  10\right\rangle +\left(  s\gamma+t\delta\right)  \left|
11\right\rangle ,
\]
so the locally normalized result is%
\[
\frac{\sqrt{\alpha^{2}+\beta^{2}}\left[  \left(  q\alpha+r\beta\right)
\left|  00\right\rangle +\left(  s\alpha+t\beta\right)  \left|
01\right\rangle \right]  }{\sqrt{\left(  q\alpha+r\beta\right)  ^{2}+\left(
s\alpha+t\beta\right)  ^{2}}}+\frac{\sqrt{\gamma^{2}+\delta^{2}}\left[
\left(  q\gamma+r\delta\right)  \left|  10\right\rangle +\left(
s\gamma+t\delta\right)  \left|  11\right\rangle \right]  }{\sqrt{\left(
q\gamma+r\delta\right)  ^{2}+\left(  s\gamma+t\delta\right)  ^{2}}},
\]
in contrast to the globally normalized result of%
\[
\frac{\left(  q\alpha+r\beta\right)  \left|  00\right\rangle +\left(
s\alpha+t\beta\right)  \left|  01\right\rangle +\left(  q\gamma+r\delta
\right)  \left|  10\right\rangle +\left(  s\gamma+t\delta\right)  \left|
11\right\rangle }{\sqrt{\left(  q\alpha+r\beta\right)  ^{2}+\left(
s\alpha+t\beta\right)  ^{2}+\left(  q\gamma+r\delta\right)  ^{2}+\left(
s\gamma+t\delta\right)  ^{2}}}.
\]

So, what's wrong with these prescriptions? \ Nothing, as long as you can
stomach the following:

\textbf{(1) Distinguishability of non-orthogonal states.} \ Here's how to
distinguish $d=\Omega\left(  \sqrt{p}\right)  $\ states of a single qubit with
constant probability of error, under option (i) (and therefore under (ii) and
(iii) as well). \ Let the $j^{th}$\ state be $\left\vert \psi_{j}\right\rangle
=\cos\left(  \pi j/d\right)  \left\vert 0\right\rangle +\sin\left(  \pi
j/d\right)  \left\vert 1\right\rangle $ where $j\in\left\{  0,\ldots
,d-1\right\}  $. \ Apply a $d\times d$\ unitary matrix to $\left\vert \psi
_{j}\right\rangle $\ whose first two columns are%
\[
\left(
\begin{array}
[c]{c}%
\cos\left(  \pi0/d\right)  /\sqrt{d}\\
\vdots\\
\cos\left(  \pi\left(  d-1\right)  /d\right)  /\sqrt{d}%
\end{array}
\right)  ,\left(
\begin{array}
[c]{c}%
\sin\left(  \pi0/d\right)  /\sqrt{d}\\
\vdots\\
\sin\left(  \pi\left(  d-1\right)  /d\right)  /\sqrt{d}%
\end{array}
\right)  .
\]
Then measure in the standard basis. \ Suppose without loss of generality that
$j=0$ and that $d$ is odd; then the probability of any outcome other than $0$
being measured is $q/\left(  q+1\right)  $\ where%
\begin{align*}
q  &  =2\sum_{k=1}^{\left(  d-1\right)  /2}\left\vert \cos\left(  \frac{\pi
k}{d}\right)  \right\vert ^{p}\\
&  \leq2\sum_{k=1}^{\left(  d-1\right)  /2}\left(  1-\frac{\left(  \pi
k/d\right)  ^{2}}{2}+\frac{\left(  \pi k/d\right)  ^{4}}{24}\right)  ^{p}\\
&  \leq2\sum_{k=1}^{\left(  d-1\right)  /2}\left(  1-\frac{\pi^{2}k^{2}%
}{4d^{2}}\right)  ^{2p}\\
&  \leq2\sum_{k=1}^{\left(  d-1\right)  /2}\exp\left(  -\frac{\pi^{2}k^{2}%
p}{2d^{2}}\right)
\end{align*}
which is bounded away from $1$ so long as $p\geq cd^{2}$\ for some constant
$c$. \ It would be interesting to obtain bounds on how many states can be
reliably distinguished in higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

\textbf{(2) Superluminal signalling.} \ Under option (ii), given an EPR pair,
Alice can communicate a bit to Bob by mapping $\left\vert 00\right\rangle
+\left\vert 11\right\rangle $\ to either $\left\vert 00\right\rangle
+\varepsilon\left\vert 11\right\rangle $\ or $\varepsilon\left\vert
00\right\rangle +\left\vert 11\right\rangle $. \ Indeed, using the ideas from
part (1), she can communicate $\Omega\left(  \sqrt{p}\right)  $\ bits to Bob
using a single EPR pair! \ I conjecture this is tight. \ Under options (i) and
(iii), Alice can communicate a bit to Bob given enough EPR pairs, by taking
advantage of Bob's ability to distinguish nonorthogonal states. \ Note that
under options (ii) and (iii), superluminal signalling is possible even when
$p=2$.

\textbf{(3) Efficient solubility of }$\mathsf{NP}$\textbf{-complete and even
harder problems.} \ Suppose you're given a Boolean function $f:\left\{
0,1\right\}  ^{n}\rightarrow\left\{  0,1\right\}  $. \ Under option (ii),
first prepare $\sum_{x}\left\vert x\right\rangle \left\vert f\left(  x\right)
\right\rangle $, then apply the nonunitary gate%
\begin{equation}
G=\left(
\begin{array}
[c]{cc}%
2^{-2n} & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{array}
\right)  \label{gateg}%
\end{equation}
to the $f$ register and measure to learn whether there exists an $x$ such that
$f\left(  x\right)  =1$. \ Indeed, Section \ref{POSTBQP} shows that under
options (i), (ii), and (iii), you could solve even $\mathsf{PP}$-complete
problems in polynomial time, which are believed to be harder than
$\mathsf{NP}$-complete problems.

\textbf{(4) Singularity.} \ Under options (ii) and (iii), the matrix $A$ could
be arbitrarily close to a non-invertible matrix, which can map nonzero states
to the zero state.

\section{Quantum Computing With Postselection\label{POSTBQP}}

This section can be skipped by physicists with no interest in computational
complexity.\footnote{The rest of paper can be skipped by computational
complexity theorists with no interest in physics.} \ Its goal is to show that,
if you change quantum mechanics in any of three ways, then the class of
problems efficiently solvable on a quantum computer expands drastically, from
$\mathsf{BQP}$\ (Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-Time) to $\mathsf{PP}%
$\ (Probabilistic Polynomial-Time). \ Here $\mathsf{PP}$\ is a well-studied
classical complexity class, consisting of all decision problems for which
there exists a probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine that accepts with
probability at least $1/2$\ if the answer is \textquotedblleft
yes,\textquotedblright\ and with probability less than $1/2$\ if the answer is
\textquotedblleft no.\textquotedblright\ \ The three changes that would give
quantum computers the power of $\mathsf{PP}$\ are: replacing the $2$-norm by
the $p$-norm for any $p\neq2$,\footnote{If $p$ is not a positive even integer,
then the power increases \textit{at least} to $\mathsf{PP}$ and possibly
further.} allowing arbitrary invertible matrices instead of just unitary
matrices, or allowing postselection on measurement outcomes. \ Any
\textit{combination} of these changes would also yield $\mathsf{PP}$. \ Note,
however, that I always assume global normalization (corresponding to options
(i) and (ii) in Section \ref{PNORM}).

It will be convenient to define a new complexity class:

\begin{definition}
\label{postbqpdef}$\mathsf{PostBQP}$ (or $\mathsf{BQP}$\ with postselection)
is the class of languages $L$ for which there exists a uniform family of
polynomial-size quantum circuits such that for all inputs $x$,

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] At the end of the computation, the first qubit has a nonzero
probability of being measured to be $\left\vert 1\right\rangle $.

\item[(ii)] If $x\in L$, then conditioned on the first qubit being $\left\vert
1\right\rangle $, the second qubit is $\left\vert 1\right\rangle $\ with
probability at least $2/3$.

\item[(iii)] If $x\notin L$, then conditioned on the first qubit being
$\left\vert 1\right\rangle $, the second qubit is $\left\vert 1\right\rangle
$\ with probability at most $1/3$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Intuitively, postselection\ means that at some point in the computation, you
can measure a qubit that has a nonzero probability of being $\left\vert
1\right\rangle $, and \textit{assume} that the outcome will be $\left\vert
1\right\rangle $\ (or equivalently, discard all runs where the outcome is
$\left\vert 0\right\rangle $). \ Just as Bernstein and Vazirani \cite{bv}%
\ showed that intermediate measurements don't increase the power of ordinary
quantum computers, so it's easy to show that intermediate postselection steps
don't increase the power of $\mathsf{PostBQP}$ (since these steps can all be
deferred to the end). \ On the other hand, if operations can be performed
conditioned on measurement outcomes, then mixing postselection and measurement
steps \textit{could} increase the power of $\mathsf{PostBQP}$.

In the remainder of the section, I'll first show that $\mathsf{PostBQP}%
=\mathsf{PP}$\ (Theorem \ref{postbqppp}), and then use that result to prove
that the other changes also give quantum computers the power of $\mathsf{PP}$.

\begin{theorem}
\label{postbqppp}$\mathsf{PostBQP}=\mathsf{PP}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The inclusion $\mathsf{PostBQP}\subseteq\mathsf{PP}$ follows easily from the
techniques used by Adleman, DeMarrais, and Huang \cite{adh}\ to show that
$\mathsf{BQP}\subseteq\mathsf{PP}$.

For the other direction, let $f:\left\{  0,1\right\}  ^{n}\rightarrow\left\{
0,1\right\}  $\ be a Boolean function and let $s=\left\vert \left\{
x:f\left(  x\right)  =1\right\}  \right\vert $. \ Then we need to decide in
$\mathsf{PostBQP}$\ whether $s<2^{n-1}$ or $s>2^{n-1}$. \ (As a technicality,
we can guarantee using padding that $s>0$ and $s\neq2^{n-1}$.) \ The algorithm
is as follows: first prepare $2^{-n/2}\sum_{x\in\left\{  0,1\right\}  ^{n}%
}\left\vert x\right\rangle \left\vert f\left(  x\right)  \right\rangle $.
\ Then following Abrams and Lloyd \cite{al}, apply Hadamard gates to all $n$
qubits in the first register and postselect\footnote{Actually postselection is
overkill here, since the first register has at least $1/4$ probability of
being $\left\vert 0\right\rangle ^{\otimes n}$.} on that register being
$\left\vert 0\right\rangle ^{\otimes n}$,\ to obtain $\left\vert
0\right\rangle ^{\otimes n}\left\vert \psi_{s}\right\rangle $\ where%
\[
\left\vert \psi_{s}\right\rangle =\frac{\left(  2^{n}-s\right)  \left\vert
0\right\rangle +s\left\vert 1\right\rangle }{\sqrt{\left(  2^{n}-s\right)
^{2}+s^{2}}}.
\]
Next, for some positive real $\alpha,\beta$\ to be specified later, prepare
$\alpha\left\vert 0\right\rangle \left\vert \psi_{s}\right\rangle
+\beta\left\vert 1\right\rangle \left\vert \phi_{s}\right\rangle $ where
\[
\left\vert \phi_{s}\right\rangle =\frac{2^{n}\left\vert 0\right\rangle
+\left(  2^{n}-2s\right)  \left\vert 1\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2\left(
2^{n}-s\right)  ^{2}+2s^{2}}}%
\]
is the result of applying a Hadamard to $\left\vert \psi_{s}\right\rangle $.
\ Postselecting on the second qubit being $\left\vert 1\right\rangle $\ then
yields the state%
\[
\left\vert \varphi_{s,\beta/\alpha}\right\rangle =\frac{\alpha s\left\vert
0\right\rangle +\sqrt{1/2}\beta\left(  2^{n}-2s\right)  \left\vert
1\right\rangle }{\sqrt{\alpha^{2}s^{2}+\beta^{2}\left(  2^{n}-2s\right)
^{2}/2}}%
\]
in the first qubit. \ A simple calculation now reveals that if $s<2^{n-1}$,
then there exists an integer $i$\ in the range $\left[  -n,n\right]  $\ such
that%
\[
\left\vert \left\langle +|\varphi_{s,2^{i}}\right\rangle \right\vert
\geq\frac{1+\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}}\approx0.986
\]
where $\left\vert +\right\rangle =\left(  \left\vert 0\right\rangle
+\left\vert 1\right\rangle \right)  /\sqrt{2}$.\ \ If $s>2^{n-1}$,\ on the
other hand, then for all such $i$\ we have $\left\vert \left\langle
+|\varphi_{s,2^{i}}\right\rangle \right\vert \leq1/\sqrt{2}$. \ So by running
the whole algorithm $n\left(  2n+1\right)  $\ times in parallel, with
$n$\ invocations for each integer $i\in\left[  -n,n\right]  $, we can learn
whether $s<2^{n-1}$ or $s>2^{n-1}$\ with exponentially small probability of error.
\end{proof}

Let $\mathsf{BQP}_{\text{\textsf{nu-global}}}$\ be the class of problems
solvable by a uniform family of polynomial-size, bounded-error quantum
circuits, if the circuits can consist of arbitrary invertible gates, not just
unitary gates. \ Option (ii) from Section \ref{PNORM}\ is used for
normalization; that is, before a measurement, the amplitude $\alpha_{x}$\ of
each basis state $\left\vert x\right\rangle $\ is divided by $\sqrt{\sum
_{y}\left\vert \alpha_{y}\right\vert ^{2}}$.

\begin{proposition}
\label{nuglobal}$\mathsf{BQP}_{\text{\textsf{nu-global}}}=\mathsf{PP}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The inclusion $\mathsf{BQP}_{\text{\textsf{nu-global}}}\subseteq\mathsf{PP}%
$\ follows easily from Ref. \cite{adh}. \ For the other direction, by Theorem
\ref{postbqppp}\ it suffices to observe that $\mathsf{PostBQP}\subseteq
\mathsf{BQP}_{\text{\textsf{nu-global}}}$. \ To postselect on a qubit being
$\left\vert 1\right\rangle $, simply apply the nonunitary gate $G$ from
Equation \ref{gateg}.
\end{proof}

Define $\mathsf{BQP}_{\text{\textsf{nu-local}}}$\ similarly to $\mathsf{BQP}%
_{\text{\textsf{nu-global}}}$, except that after every gate $G$, option (iii)
(local normalization) is applied to the qubits acted on by $G$. \ Assume that
arbitrary $1$- and $2$-qubit gates are available to polynomially many bits of precision.

\begin{proposition}
\label{nulocal}$\mathsf{PP}\subseteq\mathsf{BQP}_{\text{\textsf{nu-local}}%
}\subseteq\mathsf{PSPACE}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
For $\mathsf{PP}\subseteq\mathsf{BQP}_{\text{\textsf{nu-local}}}$, observe
that in the proof of Theorem \ref{postbqppp}, the only essential postselection
steps are applied to $2$-qubit pure states unentangled with anything else.
\ For $2$-qubit gates acting on these states, local normalization is the same
as global normalization.

For $\mathsf{BQP}_{\text{\textsf{nu-local}}}\subseteq\mathsf{PSPACE}$, let
$\alpha_{x}^{\left(  t\right)  }$\ be the amplitude of basis state $\left\vert
x\right\rangle $\ at time $t$. \ Then for all $x,t$\ we can write $\alpha
_{x}^{\left(  t\right)  }$ as a function of $\alpha_{y_{1}}^{\left(
t-1\right)  },\ldots,\alpha_{y_{k}}^{\left(  t-1\right)  }$\ for some constant
$k$ and basis states $\left\vert y_{1}\right\rangle ,\ldots,\left\vert
y_{k}\right\rangle $. \ This immediately implies a depth-first recursive
algorithm (using a polynomial amount of memory) for approximating any
amplitude $\alpha_{x}^{\left(  t\right)  }$ to polynomially many bits of precision.
\end{proof}

Finally, for any nonnegative real number $p$, define $\mathsf{BQP}_{p}%
$\ similarly to $\mathsf{BQP}$, except that the probability of measuring a
basis state $\left\vert x\right\rangle $\ equals $\left\vert \alpha
_{x}\right\vert ^{p}/\sum_{y}\left\vert \alpha_{y}\right\vert ^{p}$. \ (Thus
$\mathsf{BQP}_{2}=\mathsf{BQP}$.) \ All gates are unitary.

\begin{proposition}
\label{bqpp}$\mathsf{PP}\subseteq\mathsf{BQP}_{p}\subseteq\mathsf{P}%
^{\mathsf{\#P}}$ for all constants $p\neq2$, and $\mathsf{BQP}_{p}%
=\mathsf{PP}$ provided $p$ is an even integer greater than $2$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The inclusion $\mathsf{BQP}_{p}\subseteq\mathsf{P}^{\mathsf{\#P}}$\ is
obvious. \ To simulate $\mathsf{BQP}_{p}$ in $\mathsf{PP}$ when $p$ is a
positive even integer, use the techniques of Ref. \cite{adh} (which handle the
$p=2$ case), but evaluate polynomials of degree $p$ instead of quadratic
polynomials. \ To simulate $\mathsf{PP}$ in $\mathsf{BQP}_{p}$\ when $p\neq2$,
run the algorithm of Theorem \ref{postbqppp},\ having initialized $O\left(
n^{3}/\left\vert p-2\right\vert \right)  $ ancilla qubits to $\left\vert
0\right\rangle $. \ To postselect on the $b^{th}$ qubit being $\left\vert
1\right\rangle $: if $p<2$, then\ apply Hadamards to $10pn/\left(  2-p\right)
$\ ancilla qubits conditioned on the $b^{th}$\ qubit being $\left\vert
1\right\rangle $. \ If $p>2$, then apply Hadamards to $10pn/\left(
p-2\right)  $\ ancilla qubits conditioned on the $b^{th}$\ qubit being
$\left\vert 0\right\rangle $. \ 
\end{proof}

\section{Real Amplitudes\label{REAL}}

\begin{quote}
\textquotedblleft C'mon, they're algebraically closed!\textquotedblright\ ---A
math graduate student, when asked why God would resort to complex numbers in
creating quantum mechanics
\end{quote}

To a beginner, perhaps the most unexpected fact about quantum mechanics is
that amplitudes are complex. \ As the term `imaginary' suggests, we tend to
think of complex numbers as (useful) human inventions;\ it's unsettling if the
source code of the Universe is best written in a language like Fortran with a
complex-number data type. \ Also, in contrast to what we saw in Section
\ref{PNORM}, restricting amplitudes to be real doesn't lead to a theory
obviously very different from quantum mechanics. \ All the greatest hits are
still there: interference, entanglement, Bell inequality violations,
noncommuting observables, non-unique decompositions of mixed states, universal
quantum computing, the Zeno effect, the Gleason and Kochen-Specker theorems.

Nevertheless, Section \ref{INTRO}\ recalled a subtle difference between
complex and real (or for that matter complex and quaternionic) amplitudes,
based on counting the number of parameters of a mixed state. \ This section
gives a completely different argument for why amplitudes aren't real. \ The
advantage of this argument is that it's elementary and intuitive; the
disadvantage is that it says nothing about why amplitudes are complex rather
than quaternionic.

Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a set of states, and let $\mathcal{U}$ be a set of
transformations from $\mathcal{S}$ to itself. \ Say $\mathcal{U}$ has the
\textit{square root property} if for all $U\in\mathcal{U}$, there exists
another transformation $V\in\mathcal{U}$\ such that $V\left(  V\left(
S\right)  \right)  =U\left(  S\right)  $\ for all $S\in\mathcal{S}$. \ If time
is continuous, then the importance of the square root property is obvious:
without it there are transformations that can't be interpreted as the result
of applying a fixed Hamiltonian for some interval of time. \ Even if time is
discrete, the square root property is desirable, because it allows any
$U$\ that acts over $k$ time steps to be approximated by $V^{k}$\ for some $V$
that acts over a single time step.\footnote{To write $U$ exactly as $V^{k}%
$\ we'd need \textquotedblleft a $k^{th}$\ root property,\textquotedblright
\ which also holds for quantum mechanics but fails for real quantum
mechanics.} \ Clearly quantum mechanics has the square root property: given a
unitary $U$, let $\left\vert \psi_{1}\right\rangle ,\ldots,\left\vert \psi
_{n}\right\rangle $\ be the eigenvectors of $U$ and let $\lambda_{1}%
,\ldots,\lambda_{n}$\ be the corresponding eigenvalues; then there exists a
unitary $V$ with eigenvectors $\left\vert \psi_{1}\right\rangle ,\ldots
,\left\vert \psi_{n}\right\rangle $\ and eigenvalues $\mu_{1},\ldots,\mu_{n}%
$\ such that $\mu_{j}^{2}=\lambda_{j}$, which therefore satisfies $V^{2}=U$.
\ Since every quaternion has a square root,\footnote{Indeed some, such as
$-1$, have infinitely many square roots.} the same argument shows that
quaternionic quantum mechanics has the square root property.

However, real quantum mechanics doesn't have the square root property. \ This
is immediate since orthogonal matrices such as%
\[
\left(
\begin{array}
[c]{cc}%
1 & 0\\
0 & -1
\end{array}
\right)  ,\left(
\begin{array}
[c]{cc}%
0 & 1\\
1 & 0
\end{array}
\right)
\]
with determinant $-1$\ can't be written as squares of matrices with real
determinants. \ If we want to restore the square root property, then we have
two choices. \ The first choice is to restrict to the group
$\operatorname*{SO}\left(  n\right)  $---that is, to real orthogonal matrices
with determinant $1$. \ It's not hard to see that for every $U\in
\operatorname*{SO}\left(  n\right)  $, there exists a $V\in\operatorname*{SO}%
\left(  n\right)  $\ such that $V^{2}=U$. \ On the other hand, natural
$1$-qubit operations such as the above two can only be implemented by using
ancillia qubits. \ The second choice is to allow the \textquotedblleft square
root\textquotedblright\ of $U$ to have larger dimension than $U$. \ For
example, \
\[
\left(
\begin{array}
[c]{ccc}%
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & -1 & 0
\end{array}
\right)  ^{2}=\left(
\begin{array}
[c]{ccc}%
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & -1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{array}
\right)
\]
contains the\ $1$-qubit phase flip as a $2\times2$\ submatrix. \ This is an
instance of a well-known geometrical fact, that a mirror reversal in $n$
dimensions can be accomplished by a rotation in $n+1$\ dimensions. \ Indeed,
\textit{any} $n\times n$\ orthogonal matrix $U$ has a real square root of
dimension $\left(  n+1\right)  \times\left(  n+1\right)  $, since there exists
an element of $\operatorname*{SO}\left(  n+1\right)  $ that contains $U$ as a
submatrix. \ With either choice, the price we pay is that our $n$-dimensional
theory can be fully described only in $n+1$\ dimensions. \ But the $\left(
n+1\right)  $-dimensional theory requires $n+2$\ dimensions to describe, and
so on ad infinitum---unless we declare that the $\left(  n+1\right)  ^{st}%
$\ dimension\ is physically different from dimensions $1$\ to $n$.
