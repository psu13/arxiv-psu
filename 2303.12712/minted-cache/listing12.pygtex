I have a python function  merge\PYGZus{}array, the function takes two arrays of length m, n respectively, and output a new array by merging the first m\PYGZhy{}1 element of the first array and the last n \PYGZhy{} 1 elements of the second array.
Suppose I call the merge\PYGZus{}array function in the following way:
function rec
input: one array A, integer k
code:
if the length of A is less than k, we first call rec(A + [length(A)], k) to get B
after that, call merge\PYGZus{}array(B, B) to get C
return C.
if the length of A is larger or equal to k, return A.
end rec
Can you tell me what is the execution of rec([5, 10, 88], 6) with intermediate steps?
