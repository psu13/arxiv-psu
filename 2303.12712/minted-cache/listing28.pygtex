\PYGZsh{} Solving Math with Coding
\PYGZsh{}\PYGZsh{} You are given the task of writing a python program to solve the following math problem:
For a particular peculiar pair of  dice,  the probabilities of rolling 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 on each die are in the ratio \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdl{}}\PYG{l+m}{1}\PYG{n+nb}{:}\PYG{l+m}{2}\PYG{n+nb}{:}\PYG{l+m}{3}\PYG{n+nb}{:}\PYG{l+m}{4}\PYG{n+nb}{:}\PYG{l+m}{5}\PYG{n+nb}{:}\PYG{l+m}{6}\PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdl{}}. What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 on the two dice?
\PYGZsh{}\PYGZsh{} Requirements:
\PYGZhy{} Please begin the code with \PYGZlt{}b\PYGZgt{} and end the code with \PYGZlt{}e\PYGZgt{}.
\PYGZhy{} Remember to simplify the final answer if possible. However, if the final answer is a matrix or a set or an interval, no need to simplify.
\PYGZhy{} Please express the final answer in latex without any texts and enclose the final answer in \PYG{k}{\PYGZbs{}boxed}\PYG{n+nb}{\PYGZob{}\PYGZcb{}}. You can use \PYGZdq{}solution = r\PYGZsq{}\PYG{k}{\PYGZbs{}boxed}\PYG{n+nb}{\PYGZob{}}\PYGZsq{} + sympy.latex(solution) + \PYGZsq{}\PYG{n+nb}{\PYGZcb{}}\PYGZsq{}\PYGZdq{}
\PYGZhy{} Please print the final answer using print(solution) at the end before \PYGZlt{}e\PYGZgt{}.
