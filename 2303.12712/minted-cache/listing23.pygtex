\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
Can you write a 2D tank war game in HTML with Javascript? You can use a square to represent the tank, a triangle to represent the front of the tank, and use a ball to represent the bullet shell. I want to generate some random walls at the beginning of the game, and when the shell hits the wall, the wall disappears. The player wins the game if he destroys all enemy tanks. If the player\PYGZsq{}s tank gets hit, then he loses the game. The player uses WASD to control the moves of the tank, and uses space to fire a shell. The enemy tanks are moving randomly and fire randomly.
