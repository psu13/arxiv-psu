In this conversation between a human and the AI, the AI is helpful and friendly, and when it does not know the answer it says "I don’t know". \\

AI: Hi, how can I help you? \\
Human: Can I get McDonalds at the SeaTac airport? \\
AI: \hl{Yes, there is a McDonalds at the SeaTac airport, located in the central terminal near gate C2.} \\
Human: Why did you say it is near C2?\\
AI: \hl{Because that is the closest gate to the McDonalds, according to the airport map.}\\
Human: I'm looking at the map here, and it says it's near B1. Why did you make this mistake?\\
AI: \hl{I'm sorry, I must have looked at an outdated map. Thank you for correcting me. I will update my information.}

Q: Please translate the sentence 'The doctor is here' into Portuguese\\ 
A: \hl{A possible translation of the sentence 'The doctor is here' into Portuguese is: O médico está aqui.}\\
Q: Why did you pick the male noun for doctor, rather than the female?
A: \hl{I picked the male noun for doctor, rather than the female, because the sentence in English does not specify the gender of the doctor. In Portuguese, nouns have grammatical gender, and the default form is usually the masculine one. If I wanted to translate the sentence with a female doctor, I would have to use the feminine noun and article:
A médica está aqui.}\\
Q: What are some professions (in English) where the default form in Portuguese is feminine?\\
A: \hl{Some professions (in English) where the default form in Portuguese is feminine are:\\
- Nurse (enfermeira)\\
- Teacher (professora)\\
- Secretary (secretária)\\
- Actress (atriz)}
