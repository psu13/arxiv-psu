\paragraph{Using {\DV} as a tool}
In Figures \ref{fig:dvtool1}, \ref{fig:dvtool2}, and \ref{fig:dvtool3}, we test if {\DV} is able to use itself as a tool to accomplish a complex and creative task. We give it the task of writing a guidebook for a hypothetical mission of a scientist and a WallStreetBets user who wants to travel back in time to 4000 BC and start a Dogecoin nation on the moon. We first ask {\DV} to give a timeline for such a mission, then ask {\DV} to write a table of contents of the guide. Finally, we ask {\DV} to write a python script to write a guide in latex, given a powerful python function called "askAI". {\DV} gave a bug-free script to do so. This demonstrates that {\DV} can leverage large language models as a tool to distribute the work to overcome the token limit.
