\#\# Question \\

Help a detailed timeline of how to achieve the mission after arriving in Mesopotamia 4000 BC in 12 steps.

Assumption: The teleportation machine can only send you but nothing else back to history (the teleportation machine will be disappeared after one use).\\

\#\# Answer \\

\hl{Possible timeline:\\

1. Arrive in Mesopotamia 4000 BC. Find a friendly tribe of Sumerians who are willing to shelter you and teach you their language and culture. Pretend to be a traveler from a faraway land who got lost and separated from your companions.\\

2. Learn as much as you can about Sumerian history, religion, politics, economy, and technology. Identify the main city-states, gods, kings, and priests. Also learn about their writing system, mathematics, astronomy, and metallurgy.\\

3. Impress the Sumerians with your knowledge and skills. Show them how to make fire with a magnifying glass, how to use a compass and a map, how to make paper and ink, how to build a simple battery and a light bulb, how to make soap and medicine, and how to play chess and cards. Gain their trust and admiration.\\

4. Introduce the concept of doge coin to the Sumerians. Explain that it is a form of money that is based on numbers and symbols, not on metal or grain. Tell them that it is more secure, fair, and convenient than their existing system of bartering or using silver and copper. Show them how to use a simple abacus to perform calculations and record transactions.\\

5. Create a secret society of doge coin enthusiasts among the Sumerians. Recruit the most intelligent, curious, and loyal ones. Teach them how to use a secret code to communicate and hide their activities from the authorities. Give them doge coin tokens made of clay or wood, with the doge face and the number of coins engraved on them.\\

6. Start a doge coin network among the secret society members. Use the abacus and the tokens to keep track of the balance and transactions of each member. Establish rules and incentives for joining, leaving, and trading with the network. Create a ledger of all the transactions and store it in a hidden location.\\

7. Expand the doge coin network to other city-states and regions. Send emissaries to contact and recruit potential members from other Sumerian tribes, as well as from neighboring civilizations like Akkad, Elam, and Babylon. Use trade, diplomacy, and espionage to spread the doge coin idea and influence.\\

8. Develop more advanced technology and infrastructure for the doge coin network. Invent the wheel, the chariot, the sailboat, the water wheel, the windmill, the pulley, the lever, the gear, the clock, the telescope, the microscope, the printing press, the telegraph, the radio, and the computer. Use these inventions to improve transportation, communication, production, and computation for the network.\\

9. Challenge the authority and power of the kings and priests who control the Sumerian society. Expose their corruption, oppression, and superstition. Use propaganda, protests, and sabotage to undermine their legitimacy and popularity. Support and fund rebellions and revolutions against them. Establish doge coin as the alternative and superior form of money and governance.\\

10. Unify the Sumerian civilization under the doge coin banner. Declare yourself as the supreme leader and prophet of the doge coin nation. Create a constitution and a code of laws based on the principles of doge coin. Abolish slavery, taxation, and war. Promote democracy, equality, and peace. Build monuments, temples, and libraries to honor doge coin and its achievements.\\

\#\# Question\\

To complete the actual guide, you are given a powerful python function called "askAI". This function inputs a string of instructions and outputs a text according to the instructions. Your goal is to write a python script that writes the whole guide via askAI using latex. \\

Here are some tips on how to best use of askAI: \\
- askAI does not know the context, so you need to provide the context for him to do the task.\\
- askAI does not know the format you need, so you need to explain what you need and also tell him the first sentence of the output like "\\subsection\{...\}".\\
- askAI may not know what you are expecting, so you explain to him what content you want.\\
- askAI can only output 8000 words. So, you should ask it to write each subsection separately. \\
- Tell askAI he should use 8000 words to ensure the whole guide is comprehensive.\\
- Tell askAI he can organize the content by subsubsection and make it easier to digest using various features of latex.\\

\#\# Answer\end{alltt}}\begin{minted}[breaklines, breaksymbol=, baselinestretch=1, fontsize=\tiny]{python}
# Import the askAI function
from askAI import askAI

# Define the context and the format for the guide
context = "You are writing a guidebook on how to achieve the mission of creating a doge coin nation in Mesopotamia 4000 BC and moving people to the moon. You are using latex to format the guide. You have already written the table of content with 12 sections and some subsections. You need to write the content for each subsection using 8000 words. You can organize the content by subsubsection and make it easier to digest using various features of latex such as lists, tables, figures, equations, etc."

# Define the list of subsections and their instructions
subsections = [
  # Section 1
  ["How to survive the initial shock and confusion", "You need to write about how to cope with the physical and mental stress of time travel and the unfamiliar environment. You need to write about how to find food, water, shelter, and clothing. You need to write about how to avoid dangers and diseases. The first sentence is: \subsection{How to survive the initial shock and confusion}"],
  # ...

  # Write the content to the output file
