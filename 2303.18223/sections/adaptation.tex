\section{Adaptation of LLMs}
\label{sec-adaptation}

After pre-training, LLMs can acquire the general abilities for  solving various tasks. However, an increasing number of studies have shown  that LLM's abilities can be further adapted according to specific goals.
In this section, we introduce two major approaches to adapting pre-trained LLMs, namely instruction tuning and alignment tuning. The former approach  mainly aims to enhance (or unlock) the abilities of LLMs, while the latter approach aims to align the behaviors of LLMs with human values or preferences. 
Further, we will also discuss  efficient tuning and quantization for  model adaptation in resource-limited settings.  
In what follows, we will introduce the four parts in detail.
