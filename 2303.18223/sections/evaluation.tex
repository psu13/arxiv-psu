\section{Capacity and Evaluation}
\label{sec-evaluation}
To examine the effectiveness and superiority of LLMs, a surge of tasks and benchmarks have been proposed for conducting empirical ability evaluation and analysis.
In this section, we first introduce three types of basic ability evaluation of LLMs for language generation and understanding, then present several advanced ability evaluations with more complicated settings or goals, and finally discuss existing benchmarks, evaluation approaches, and empirical analysis.
