\maketitle

Standard formulations of intuitionistic logic, whether by logicians or by category theorists, generally do not take into account partially defined elements. (For a recent reference see Makkai and Reyes [18] , esp. pp. 144--163.) Perhaps
there is a simple psychological reason: we dislike talking of those things not
already proved to exist. Certainly we should not assume that things exist without making this assumption explicit. In classical logic the problem is not important, because it is always possible to split the definition (or theorem) into cases according as the object in question does or does not exist. In intuitionistic logic this way is not open to us, and the circumstance complicates many constructions, the
theory of descriptions, for example. Many people I find do not agree with me, but
I should like to advocate in a mild way in this paper what I consider a simple extension of the usual formulation of logic allowing reference to partial elements. The discussion will be entirely formal here, but for the model theory of the system the reader should consult Fourman and Scott [10] for interpretations over a complete Heyting algebra (and this includes the so-called Kripke models) and Fourman [8]
(the paper was written in 1975) for the interpretation in an arbitrary topos.

Technically the idea is to permit a wider interpretation of {\it free} variables.
All bound variables retain their usual existential import (when we say something exists it does exist), but free variables behave in a more ``schematic'' way. Thus there will be no restrictions on the use of {\it modus ponens} or on the rule of {\it substitution} involving free variables and their occurrences. The laws of quantifiers require some modification, however, to make the existential assumptions explicit. The modification is very straightforward, and I shall argue that what has to be done is
simply what is done naturally in making a {\it relativization} of quantifiers from a
larger domain to a subdomain. Again in intuitionstic logic we have So take care over relativization, because we cannot say that either the subdomain is empty or not -- thus a given element may be only ``partially'' in the subdomain.

In Section \ref{sec1} , I discuss the idea of allowing existence as a predicate and
the laws of quantifiers. Section 2 treats the theory of identity and the connections with existence. Questions of strictness and extensionality of relations and functions are discussed in Section 3 along with some examples of first-order theories. As further examples of the use of the system, the familiar theories of apartness and ordering in intuitionistic logic are presented in Section 4 . Section 5 goes briefly into relativization, and Section 6 details the principles of descriptions. Finally, Section 7 reviews the axioms for higher-order intuitionistic logic from this general viewpoint.
The idea of schematic free variables is not new for classical logic, and the literature on ``free'' logic (or logic without existence assumptions) is extensive.
(For some earlier references see Scott [21].) All I have done in this essay is
to make what seems to me to be the obvious carryover to intuitionistic logic,
because I think it is necessary and convenient. For those who do not like this formulation, some comfort can be taken from the fact that in topos theory both kinds of systems are completely equivalent, and the domains of partial elements can be defined at higher types (this is analogous to passing from a sheaf to its ``flabbyfication'', which is a subsheaf of the power sheaf). However, in first-order logic something is lost in not allowing partial elements, as I shall try to argue along
the way.
