Gonzalez-Ballestero et al. provide an overview of the status, challenges, and prospects of levitodynamics, the multidisciplinary research area that focuses on the understanding and control of optical trapping of microparticles and nanoparticles in vacuum, with the goal of eventually using such levitated particles as ultrasensitive probes for sensing applications. —ISO A review outlines the challenges and prospects of controlling levitated nano- and micro-objects in a vacuum. The control of levitated nano- and micro-objects in vacuum—which capitalizes on scientific achievements in the fields of atomic physics, control theory, and optomechanics—is of considerable interest. The ability to couple the motion of levitated systems to internal degrees of freedom, as well as to external forces and systems, provides opportunities for science and technology. Attractive research directions, ranging from fundamental quantum physics to commercial sensors, have been unlocked by the many recent experimental achievements, including motional ground-state cooling of an optically levitated nanoparticle. Here we review the status, challenges, and prospects of levitodynamics, the multidisciplinary research area devoted to understanding, controlling, and using levitated nano- and micro-objects in vacuum.}}

	abstract = {Levitated nanoparticles and microparticles are excellent candidates for the realization of extremely isolated mechanical systems, with a huge potential impact in sensing applications and in quantum physics. Magnetic levitation based on static fields is a particularly interesting approach, due to the unique property of being completely passive and compatible with low temperatures. Here, we show experimentally that micromagnets levitated above type-I superconductors feature very low damping at low frequency and low temperature. In our experiment, we detect 5 out of 6 rigid-body mechanical modes of a levitated ferromagnetic microsphere, using a dc {SQUID} (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) with a single pick-up coil. The measured frequencies are in agreement with a finite element simulation based on ideal Meissner effect. For two specific modes we find further substantial agreement with analytical predictions based on the image method. We measure damping times \${\textbackslash}tau\$ exceeding \$10{\textasciicircum}4\$ s and quality factors \$Q\$ beyond \$10{\textasciicircum}7\$, improving by \$2-3\$ orders of magnitude over previous experiments based on the same principle. We investigate the possible residual loss mechanisms besides gas collisions, and argue that much longer damping time can be achieved with further effort and optimization. Our results open the way towards the development of ultrasensitive magnetomechanical sensors with potential applications to magnetometry and gravimetry, as well as to fundamental and quantum physics.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0176},
	abstract = {Penrose has been advocating the view that the collapse of the wave function is rooted in the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics. On the basis of conceptual analysis, he arrived at an estimate for the collapse time. To better understand his estimate, in this paper we present a thought experiment, which singles out the role of time-dilations in massive superpositions. First we investigate the behavior of a hypothetical clock containing a component which can be in a superposition of states. The clock contains a massive object, whose only purpose is to introduce a curvature of space time into the problem. We find that a state of this massive object with a smaller radius, but with the same mass, experiences a larger time dilation. Considering a coherent superposition of the large and small object, introduces an ambiguity in the definition of a common time for both states. We assert that this time ambiguity can be thought to affect the time evolution of a state in different ways and that the relative phase difference between these different interpretations can be calculated. We postulate that the wave function collapse will occur when this phase difference becomes of order unity. An absolute energy scale enters this equation and we recover Penrose's estimate for the collapse time by equating the absolute energy scale to the rest mass of the object.},
