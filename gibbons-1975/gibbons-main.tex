\ni
I wish in this talk to summarize recent work on quantum effects near
black holes. In doing so I wish to conﬁne myself to giving an outline of what
principles go into the calculations and the results. I shall not discuss any
astrophysical applications
(for which see e.g. [40]). I have tried to put the
various results in some sort of perspective and I hope that in doing so I have not given
insufﬁcient weight to anyone's contribution or incorrectly judged it.
If I have done so I apologize in advance. In my talk I hope to indicate what parts of the
theory look satisfactory and which require more work and also I
shall try to indicate parallels which other parts of physics --- especially
the theory of quantum processes in strong external electromagnetic fields.

The first indication of potentially interesting effects arose when Penrose pointed out 
the existence of what has come to be known as the ``Penrose Effect'' [1]. 
This arises because of the existence of negative energy orbits in-side the ``ergosphere''
of a rotating black hole (the region where the Killing vector which is timelike at
infinity becomes spacelike). Given a region of negative energy orbits it is possible to
extract energy --- in this case the rotational energy of the black hole. 
One simply drops in a particle with positive energy $E_1$, and lets it split (inside the region) into 
2 particles one with positive energy
$E_2$, which emerges and the other with negative energy $E_3$ which remains inside.
Since $E_1 = E_2 + E_3$ we have $E_2 > E_1$. This situation also occurs in electromagnetism
near a point charge, in special relativity or indeed in any deep enough potential well [2].
It also occurs near charged black holes [3].

In fact in any electro-magnetic background which is stationary, axisymmetric and
invariant under simultaneous inversion of time and angle coordinates one finds that the
energy $E$ and angular momentum $L$ of a particle of mass $m$ and charge $e$ must satisfy
\be
(E\, \dt + L\, \dphi + eA)^2 > m^2
\ee
where $A$ is the vector potential which falls to zero at infinity.
This expression (or a simple generalization of it if there is a third constant of the motion)
determines two surfaces $E^{\pm} (r,\theta)$ in the $(E, r, \theta)$ space between which
a classical particle cannot exist. If the surface $E^+$ can fall below $- m$ we have just the
required situation referred to sometimes as ``level crossing''. The region $r$,
is referred to as a "generalized ergosphere" for the mode in question.
It is easy to check the existence of such a region in "superheavy" atoms. If
\be
A = \Phi\, \dt + B\, \dphi; \quad \Omega = g_{\phi t}/(\gtt)
\ee
the rate of rotation of inertial frames and $\sigma^2 = (g_{\phi t})^2 - g_{\phi\phi}\gtt$ we have
\be
E^\pm = e\Phi + (L + eB)\Omega \pm \sigma^2 \sqrt{m^2 + (L + eB)^2} .
\ee
\ni
On a horizon $\sigma\rightarrow 0$ and $\Omega \rightarrow \Omega_H$, $\Phi + \Omega B \rightarrow \Omega_H$, and
$E^\pm \rightarrow e \Phi_H + L \Omega_H = \mu_H$
which may be thought of as a chemical potential for the mode in question.
