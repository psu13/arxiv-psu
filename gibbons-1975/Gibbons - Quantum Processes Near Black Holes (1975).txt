ABSTRACT

A general review is given of quantum processes near black holes with especial emphasis the Hawking Thermodynamic EmissionProcess. Astrophysical applications are not discussed.

I wish in this talk to summarize recent work on quantum effects near

black holes. In doing so I wish to conﬁne myself to giving an outline of what

principles go into the calculations and the results. I shall not discuss any

astrophysical applications

(for which see e.g. [40]). I have tried to put the

various resultsin some sort of perspective and I hope that in doing so I have not given insufﬁcient weight to anyone's contribution or incorrectly judged it. If I have done so I apologize in advance. In mytalk I hope to indicate what parts of the theory look satisfactory and which require more work and also I

shall try to indicate parallelswhich other parts of physics - especially the theory of quantum processes in strong external electromagnetic fields.

The first indication of potentially interesting effects arose when Penrose pointed out the existence of what has come to be known as the "Penrose Effect"' [1]. This arises because of the existence of negative energy orbits in-

side the "ergosphere" of a rotating black hole (the region where the Killing

vector which is timelike at infinity becomes spacelike). Given a region of negative energy orbits it is possible to extract energy - in this case the rotational energy of the black hole. One simply drops in a particle with positive energy E, and lets it split (inside the region) into 2 particles one with positive energy

E, which emerges and the other with negative energy Ez which remains inside.

Since E, = E, * Ez we have E2 > E,• This situation also occurs in electromagneti sm

charge in special relativity or indeed inany deep enough potential well [2]. It also occurs near charged black holes [3].

near a point

In fact in any electro-magnetic background which is stationary, axisymmetric and invariant under simultaneous inversion of time and angle coordinates one ﬁnds that the energy E and angular momentum L of a particle of mass m and charge e must satisfy (E dt + Lad + eA)? > m

where A is the vector potential which falls to zero at inﬁnity. This expression (or a simple generalization of it if there is a third constant of the motion) determines two surfaces E* (r,0) in the (E, r, 0) space between which a classical particle cannot exist. If the surface Et can fall below - m we have just the re-

quired situation referred to sometimes as "level crossing"'. The region r, space is referred to as a "generalized ergosphere" for the mode in question. It is easy to check the existence of such a region in "superheavy" atoms. If

On a horizon o→ 0 and 8 → 54, 8 + MB → PH E E→ eH + LAy = Hy which may be

thought of as a chemical potential for the mode in question.

From theduality between wave and particle one expects a similar phenomenon to occur for waves and indeed this turns out to be the case (Misner [4] and Zeldovich [5], and one has here the phenomenon of "super radiance." For a classical scalar ﬁeld this arises because the conserved ﬂux vector

(4)

need not necessarily be future directed timelike. An incident wave carrying positive ﬂux can send negative ﬂux down the hole and the reﬂectedpositive ﬂux

can be greater than the incident flux. All of this is very reminiscent of the

well known "Klein Paradox" situation [6] and indeed in the most general case of a charged, rotating black hole we have a rather close analogy to the Klein Paradox. In our previous notation we find the @ can be written as p = eiEte iLX and

X obeys

where Ya denotes covariant differentiation in the r, plane. The conserved

J= (Edt + Lap + A) |x|2 + (xx - xax) /21

The null generator of the horizon is l= d/at - sud/ap. The flux through the horizon is a < J,l> a E - HH. Thus it E < HH but E? < m we have superadiance. This

is of course just the previous criterion.

For classical spin ½ fields the situation is different the conserved flux

vector

is always future directed timelike and so simple super radiance is notpossible

[7]. However it is still possible for negative energy to fall down the hole since the stress tensor of a spin ½ ﬁeld does not obey the positive energy condition. Note that in both these cases a "hole" is necessary. Super radiance cannot occur unless a particle or energy can be trapped inside a certain region. Having seen how super radiance is possible, the analogy with "stimulated emission" is very close. On rather general grounds--Dirac [8] Feynman [9] Einstein [10] one expects

--at least for bosons a related "spontaneous emission." Further each mode should be emitted with a coefficient just given by the super radiant coefficient (Starobinsky [11]). Note that while these physical arguments seem quite compelling one possible objection is that they seem to imply thata black hole can be some sort of thermal equilibrium with a surrounding heat bath. This as weshall see will

turn out to be the case but at the early stages of this subject this seemed rather puzzling. Before I go on, it seems worthwhile here topoint out that interesting

as these speculations seem, the motivation for following them up would have been

rather low had it not beenin one's mind that rather small black holes (masses > planck mass ~ 10-5,g) had been postulated earlier by Hawking [12] as possibly aris-

ing in the early stages of a chaotic big bang universe, although the idea of black holessmaller than the Chandrasekhar limit had been suggested earlier by Zeldovich

[13]. In this connection these early speculations brought to light an amusing

coincidenceStarobinsky [ll] pointed out that the order of magnitude for the time for spontaneous loss of all of its angular momentum by a black hole of mass must be (in units such that G = c = h = k = 1) + ~ M3 (8)

Thus a hole would lose all of its angular momentum in less than 1010

year if its

mass werelessthan 10-13

cm - a number not without significance in other con-

texts. The extension of these ideas to the charge of a black hole [14] showed

similarly that unless the hole had a mass of this order, e me it would be energetically favorable for it to discharge itself even if it possessed a single

electron charge. The rate was expected to depend on the ﬁeld strength and in a

Schwinger [15] type way. Thus unless the electric ﬁeld is less than the critical ﬁeld mile the rate is very fast. This implied that to have a charge compara

ble with its mass the black hole mass must exceed e/m? (which is coincidentally the least mass of a "classical geon" [16]. Essentially the same ideas seem to have occurred to Zaumen [17] independently. The story has also been taken up by

Rufﬁni and Deruelle [19]and Rufﬁni and Damour [20]. These estimates made it very unlikely that mini black holes possessed charge.

Having seen the physical ideas which enter it remained to give them a

more rigorous expression. The first person to tackle this problem was Unruh [21]. Since there is at present no well worked out candidate for a quantum theory of gravity Unruhadopted an approach in which the gravitational field was treated as

a classical background--the so called external field approach. Thus one takes

the equations describing a free quantum field in flat space and minimally couples them to the external field by the replacement d H- ieA. This does not always yield a sensible theory [41] but in the case of spin 0, ½ and I a workable

theory results.

The next problem one encounters is thedefinition of particle states or may be summarized as follows: the basic strategy of the quanvacuum state. This

tum theory of fields is to resolve a field into normal modes. The coefficients of these normal modes obey the familiar bose einstein/ fermi-dirac commutation/ anticommutation relations. This gives field commutation/anticommutationrelations which are independent of the choice of normal modes--provided they are

properly normalized with the natural sesqui-linear form available:

(9.1)

for spin ½

(9.2) What is not independent of the choice is the vacuum state. Any transformation of the normal modes (Bogoliubov transformation) which mixes up particle and antiparticle modes (or positive and negative frequencies to use a conventional expres-

sion) will give aninequivalent deﬁnition of the vacuum state. Indeed it--as

seems to occur in most practical examples the number of "created particles" diverges the two different statevectors may not even be connected by a unitary transformation [22]. Unruh made a particular choice--essentially that the particle modes be positive frequency with respect to the Killing vector d/at in the Kerr solution. He then computed the stress tensor expectation value ‹T

this state and found that although ‹Too was inﬁnite, «Tor was ﬁnite and corresponded to an outwardﬂux of super radiant modes at the expected rate. Simi-

lar results were subsequently found by Ford [23]. It should be mentioned that the gravitational background used was the maximally extended Kerr solution. We see that in general we meet threegeneric types of problem:

(1) choice of vacuum state

(2) infinities in T

HV

(3) breakdownfor higher spins.

All of these problems occur and are familiar in the corresponding electromagnetic

case. The next advance came with the work of Hawking [24]. He realized that

(1) One can only satisfactorily define particle states at infinity

(2) One must for a satisfactory treatment take collapseinto account. To take the first point--Hawking decided-- in the spirit of the -matrix

approach to define two vacua, the in vacuum and the out vacuum 10_ >, 10+ Provided past infinity constitutes a cauchy surface (thus excluding the mixed white

hole/black hole situation considered by Unruh) one may define an initial no particle state by the usual prescription of associating positive frequencies with particle states andconversely negative frequencies with anti-particle states. Since the idea of positive frequency is invariant under the asymptotic symmetry group--the B.M.S. group this remains valid even in the presence of gravitational radiation. Indeed one canshow that the gravitational ﬁeld of a plane wave (like a plane electromagnetic wave) is incapable of producing particles [25]. Since at inﬁnity any ingoing radiation will be effectively planeit is clear that as far

as past inﬁnity is concerned we have a reasonable deﬁnition of what it means to

say that there are initially no ingoing particles. Similarly we can identify outgoing particles at future infinity. The task of identifying particle states in the interaction region is much less clear. This is perhaps not unreasonable-physically a particle isreally a certain sort of normal mode with high symmetry--

mathematically it is connected with irreducible representations ofthe Poincare

Group [26]. Neither of these concepts is applicable near the black hole. These remarks do not apply to the strong electromagnetic field arounda large black hole since here the typical wavelength of the created particles is much smaller than the horizon size.

Now to turn to the next point. The problem is tocount the number of out-

going particlesin

state which initially contained no ingoing particles. (We are working in the Heisenberg picture.)

Nout = <0-1 (aout) + out 10 - >

(10)

Taking the collapse into account and the very high redshifts associated with the formation of the event horizon Hawking was able to show that this number diverges which he also showed corresponded to a steady emission at a rate

it was necessary to include the collapse in order to give meaning to the calcula-

tion the details of the collapse do not enter at all into the answer.

If one does

not consider the collapse then the most natural way of doing the calculations (i.e. in the fully extended Kruskal manifold) give no production [27]. It should be pointed out that the result one gets in the Kruskal manifold depends crucially on what boundary conditions one sets on the past horizon. A suitable choice could in principle yield any desired result. Unruh has pointed out that one may obtain Hawking's result by chosing as part of one's set of normal modes a set entering the external region of the black hole from the past horizon and behaving like a complex exponential of the affine parameter onthe post horizon (see his article). Secondly in order to obtain the result it is necessary to take into account normal modes of arbitrarily high energy(way above the Planck frequency) essentially because of the redshifting effect of the horizon. Indeed, if one imposes a cut

off of frequence we the emission will stop after a time t~ K'' log(w /K). This in fact is likely to be true in any calculation since it comes from considering

how close to the horizon (in terms of an afﬁne parameter) you have to be in order that you can send signals which reach inﬁnity at a retarded time. Thirdly we have here just the thermal emission which was lacking in our previous physical

arguments--although

Itshould the 

analogy between atomic levels and a black hole is not

absolutely precise. be mentioned here that the idea that a black hole

has associated with it a temperature and an entropy (which is of course what these results imply) had been suggested previously by Beckenstein [28] on the basisof certain analogies between black hole physics and thermodynamics (cf. [29]) --the non-decreasing event horizon area playing the part of entropy. The precise

relation is now seen to be S = Au/4.

One could of course spend a great deal of time describing the implications

of these spectacular results. In what follows I shall bring out just a few points.

Before proceeding, however, I should note that Hawking's work encompasses all the previous results of Unruh and Starobinsky as limiting cases. The way in which

this comes about for charged black holes and the relation of all this to the well known formulae due to Schwinger [15] for particle creation in uniform electric ﬁelds has been described by myself [30] cf also [20]. There are of course obvi-

ous analogies with thermionic emission from metal surfaces, el acting as a "work

function."

It is sometimes said that the super-radiant processes like particle crea-

uniform static electric ﬁeld do not require a time dependent ﬁeld in contradistinction to the Hawking process. This is not really correct. The sta-

tion in

tionary (and in general non physical) backgrounds can only be used inconjunction with boundary conditions. These boundary conditions relate to what particles enter the space from the past horizon or from the inﬁnite past respectively.

This decision is made (via the choice of boundary conditions for Feynman propagators or a choice of a complete set of normal modes) in a way appropriate for a

situation in which the interaction is "turned off"' in the inifnite past. From

this point of view the "method of level crossing" amounts to:

1. a particular choice of normal modes (proportional to exp iwt).

2. a method of deciding whether the ingoing antiparticles overlap with

outgoing particles (i.e. whether the Bogoliubov coefﬁcients vanish

or not

3. an elegant representation of how large the effects will be by computing transmission coefﬁcients in a certain effective potential. This

is explained in more detail by Dr. Damour in his article and in [30] but the essential point is that what is a particle or antiparticle determined by theflux it carries through a cauchysurface. As

explained earlier this depends, for horizon modes, Thus roughly speaking, a wave can appear as antiparticle neart:the horizon ( (E - HH) < 0) but as a particle at infinity (E > 0) . From what has been said aboveit is clear that for all its spectacular

successes, Hawking's derivation of

his result is not entirely satisfactory. (For

an alternative attempt see [311, for skeptical remarks (32], (33].), This it seems to any fault on Hawking's part but dueto the intrinsic unsatis-

to me isnot due 

factories of the whole external ﬁeld theory method. For instance we still have the divergences in T particles) which need to be wu land in the total number of taken into account before we begin to feed back this expectation value into a Hartree-Fock version of Einstein's equations--if indeed that is appropriate. Some

of these infinities can be absorbed as infinite renormalizations of the cosmolo-

gical constant and Newton's constant G. Some, however, are ofan essentially new king, as has been pointed out by DeWitt [34]. In terms of an effective Lagrangian they correspond to terms of the form R • No detailed calcu-

and (Rab gab, 2

lations of these to have be been little ground given in for the doubting black hole their case existence. (where in Thus fact Rab even gab the = 0) seems

external ﬁeld problemis unrenormalizable whichis closely related to the fact

that the only quantum theory of gravity which is amenable to calculations suffers from the same defect [35]. One might also worry that particle interactions have not been taken into account. This is presumably valid for large holes but for holes of size 10 13cm this considerable flux of particles in such a small volume should surely require the use of interacting field theory.

All of these problems are deep and difficult, what I want to do in the final part of the talk is to cut through the Gordian Knot as it were, disregard

the original ﬁeld theory derivation and hang everything on the thermodynamic idea.

Before doing so it is perhaps worthwhile trying to see why a black hole should give a thermal spectrum at all. The most natural interpretation isthat the Hawkingprocess consists of verymany individual events consisting of the creation of a virtual pair near the hole and the tunnelling of a member (presuma-

bly carrying negative energy) through the horizon, the other reaching infinity.

What is seen is a statistical ensemble of such independent events each happening with a probability proportional to the phase space available. The factor Ti arises because the particles are created (in some sense) near the horizon and have to tunnel out through a combined curvature and centrifugal barrier. In all such calculations we need a constraint and in fact if we constrain the rate of

dissipation of entropy or irreducible mass we obtain the Hawking formulae--with of course the temperature undetermined. Thus a black hole emits thermally because it is the most likely thing for it to do. Support for the idea comes from the work of Wald [22] and Parker [36] who have shownthat the statistics of outgoing

particles are those of a black body.

Given that we have a small body whose temperature decreases the more

energy it loses. This is, of course, a manifestation of the well knownfact that

gravitating systems can have negative specific heats. The evolution of such

456

G.W. Gibbons

system will be towards a hotter and hotter state--the black hole presumably dis-

altogether, andpresumably with it the baryons that make it up. To my knowledge now one has mechanism whereby black holes can emit more baryons than

appearing

antibaryon without making use of long range fields carrying baryonic charge [37].

If we adopt the thermodynamic viewpoint even when particle interactions aretaken into account, then presumably a black hole will emit precisely what it would accrete from a heat bath at the same temperature. In terms of our simple arguments before the probability of emission is now no longer simply proportional to the available phase space. Carter, Lin and Perry and myself [38] have recently made some rough calculations on the basis. We represented a heat bath of strongly interacting particles as a perfect fluid with an equation of state. The accretion problem is straight forward and the corresponding emission is described by a sort of stellar wind. The interesting thing about our calculation isthat provided the high density gas has a reasonably hardequation ofstate the wind is essentially transparent. This indicates that interactions might not be very

important. It is perhaps worth reemphasizing here that for higher spin (s > 3

the external ﬁeld theory approach breaks down.

In this thermodynamic vein it is amusing to note that in this light the old theory of black body radiation requires revision. Consider a cavity of ﬁxed volume V. They ﬁll it with more and more energy.

At ﬁrst the cavity will contain an ordinary black body gas and its temperature will rise. As it does, however, a qualitatively different behavior sets in. We have to maximize the entropy, S, of the conﬁguration subject to the

energy, E, being held constant.

s = 4M? + 4 aVT'

(13.1)

E = M + avT*

(13.2)

a is Stefans constant.

if x = M/E and y = (av/E5) /31

This amounts to maximizing F = x + y (1-x) 3/4 on 10,11. For y > 253'5-54 = 1.4266 has no turning points and its greatest value is attained at x = 0 (pure radiation). For 1.4266 > y > 1.01440 there is a local minimum at x < 4 and a

5

local maximum at x < 5 but that x = 0 is still the global maximum. For y<

1.01440 the local maximum at x > 0.97702 is also a global maximum. Thus for a

box with sufﬁcient energy a black hole of mass M = [8]'' will condense out. As the energy of the enclosure is further increased the temperature will drop.

x 3/4 (av) - 1/5 Thus for any volume V there is a maximum temperature Tm = (87) *'

- 1/47 c; x = 0.97702 Ус = 1.01440. The point of the example is to indicate how basic Hawking's discovery is

in relation to our views of fundamental physics. What part the sort of speculations contained in [38] on the deeper role that black holes have to play in the
