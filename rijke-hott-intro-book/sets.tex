\section{Set theory}

In this section we construct the quotient of a type by an equivalence relation. By an equivalence relation we understand a binary relation $R:A\to(A\to\prop)$ which is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. In particular, we note that equivalence relations take values in $\prop$. The quotient $A/R$ is constructed as the type of equivalence classes, which is just the image of the map $R:A\to (A\to\prop)$. Thus, our construction of the quotient by an equivalence relation is very much like the classical construction of a quotient set. Examples of set quotients are abundant. We cover two of them: the type of rational numbers and the set truncation of a type.

There is, however, a subtle issue with our construction of the set quotient as the image of the map $R:A\to(A\to\prop)$. What is the universe level of the quotient $A/R$? Let us suppose that $\UU$ is a universe that contains $A$ and each $R(x,y)$. Then $\prop$, the type of propositions in $\UU$, is a type in the universe $\UU^+$, constructed in \cref{rmk:universe-constructions}. Therefore the type $\prop^A$ as well as the quotient $A/R$ are also types in $\UU^+$. That seems unfortunate, because in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory the quotient of a set by an equivalence relation is an ordinary set, and not a more general class.

In Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory quotients are are sets because of the axiom schema of replacement. The replacement axioms assert that the image of any function is again a set. This leads us to wonder about a type theoretical variant of the replacement axioms. Indeed, there is such a variant. The type theoretic replacement property asserts that for any map $f:A\to B$ from a type $A$ in $\UU$ to a type $B$ of which the \emph{identity types} are equivalent to types in $\UU$, the image of $f$ is also equivalent to a type in $\UU$, and in fact this property is a theorem. We prove it in \cref{thm:replacement}, using the univalence axiom and a new construction of the image of a map.

\subsection{Equivalence relations}

\begin{defn}\label{defn:eq_rel}
Let $R:A\to (A\to\prop)$ be a binary relation valued in the propositions. We say that $R$ is an \define{equivalence relation}\index{equivalence relation} if $R$ comes equipped with
\begin{align*}
\rho & : \prd{x:A}R(x,x) \\
\sigma & : \prd{x,y:A} R(x,y)\to R(y,x) \\
\tau & : \prd{x,y,z:A} R(x,y)\to (R(y,z)\to R(x,z)),
\end{align*}
witnessing that $R$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
  Let $R:A\to (A\to\prop)$ be an equivalence relation. The \define{equivalence class} of $x:A$ is defined to be
  \begin{equation*}
    [x]_R\defeq R(x).
  \end{equation*}
  More generally, a subtype $P:A\to \prop$ is said to be an \define{equivalence class} if it satisfies
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathsf{is\usc{}equivalence\usc{}class}(P)\defeq\exists_{(x:A)}P=R(x).
  \end{equation*}
  Furthermore, we define $A/R$ to be the type of equivalence classes, i.e., we define
  \begin{equation*}
    A/R\defeq \sm{P:A\to\prop}\mathsf{is\usc{}equivalence\usc{}class}(P).
  \end{equation*}
\end{defn}

In other words, $A/R$ is the image of the map $[{-}]_R:A\to (A\to\prop)$. In the following proposition we characterize the identity type of $A/R$. As a corollary, we obtain equivalences
\begin{equation*}
  ([x]_R=[y]_R)\simeq R(x,y),
\end{equation*}
justifying that the quotient $A/R$ is defined to be the type of equivalence classes. Note that in our characterization of the identity type of $A/R$ we make use of the univalence axiom.

\begin{prp}\label{prp:eq-quotient}
  Let $R:A\to (A\to\prop)$ be an equivalence relation. Furthermore, consider $x:A$ and an equivalence class $P$. Then the canonical map
  \begin{equation*}
    ([x]_R=P)\to P(x)
  \end{equation*}
  is an equivalence.
\end{prp}

\begin{proof}
  By \cref{thm:id_fundamental} it suffices to show that the total space
  \begin{equation*}
    \sm{P:A/R}P(x)
  \end{equation*}
  is contractible. The center of contraction is of course $[x]_R$, which satisfies $[x]_R(x)$ by reflexivity of $R$. It remains to construct a contraction. Since $\sm{P:A/R}P(x)$ is a subtype of $A/R$, we construct a contraction by showing that
  \begin{equation*}
    [x]_R=P
  \end{equation*}
  whenever $P(x)$ holds. Recall that $P$ is an equivalence relation, i.e., that there exists a $y:A$ such that $P=[y]_R$. Note that our goal is a proposition, so we may assume that we have such a $y$. Then we obtain that $R(x,y)$ holds from the assumption that $P(x)$ holds. Thus, we have to show that
  \begin{equation*}
    [x]_R=[y]_R
  \end{equation*}
  given that $R(x,y)$ holds. By function extensionality and the univalence axiom, it is equivalent to show that
  \begin{equation*}
    \prd{z:A}R(x,z)\simeq R(y,z)
  \end{equation*}
  We get a function $R(x,z)\to R(y,z)$ by transitivity, since $R(y,x)$ holds by symmetry. Conversely, we get a function $R(y,z)\to R(x,z)$ directly by transitivity. Thus, we obtain that
  \begin{equation*}
    R(x,z)\leftrightarrow R(y,z)
  \end{equation*}
  for any $z:A$, which is sufficient to prove that they are equivalent because $R$ is valued in $\prop$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}\label{cor:eq-quotient}
  Consider an equivalence relation $R$ on a type $A$, and let $x,y:A$. Then there is an equivalence
  \begin{equation*}
    ([x]_R=[y]_R)\simeq R(x,y).
  \end{equation*}
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
  By \cref{prp:eq-quotient} we have an equivalence
  \begin{equation*}
    ([x]_R=[y]_R)\simeq R(y,x).
  \end{equation*}
  Moreover, $R(y,x)$ is equivalent to $R(x,y)$ by symmetry of $R$.
\end{proof}

\begin{comment}
The notion of $0$-equivalence relation which we defined in \cref{defn:eq_rel} fits in a hierarchy of `$n$-equivalence relations'\index{n-equivalence relation@{$n$-equivalence relation}}, the study of which is a research topic on its own. However, we already know an example of a relation that should count as an `$\infty$-equivalence relation'\index{infinity-equivalence relation@{$\infty$-equivalence relation}}: the identity type. Analogous to \cref{thm:equivalence_classes}, the following theorem shows that the canonical map
\begin{equation*}
(x=y)\to (\idtypevar{A}(x)=\idtypevar{A}(y))
\end{equation*}
is an equivalence, for any $x,y:A$. In other words, $\idtypevar{A}(x)$ can be thought of as the equivalence class of $x$ with respect to the relation $\idtypevar{A}$.

\begin{thm}
Assuming the univalence axiom on $\UU$, the map
\begin{equation*}
\idtypevar{A}:A\to (A\to\UU)
\end{equation*}
is an embedding, for any type $A:\UU$.\index{identity type!is an embedding}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Let $a:A$. By function extensionality it suffices to show that the canonical map
\begin{equation*}
(a=b)\to \idtypevar{A}(a)\htpy\idtypevar{A}(b)
\end{equation*}
that sends $\refl{a}$ to $\lam{x}\refl{(a=x)}$ is an equivalence for every $b:A$, and by univalence it therefore suffices to show that the canonical map
\begin{equation*}
(a=b)\to \prd{x:A}\eqv{(a=x)}{(b=x)}
\end{equation*}
that sends $\refl{a}$ to $\lam{x}\idfunc[(a=x)]$ is an equivalence for every $b:B$. To do this we employ the type theoretic Yoneda lemma, \cref{thm:yoneda}.

By the type theoretic Yoneda lemma\index{Yoneda lemma} we have an equivalence
\begin{equation*}
\Big(\prd{x:A} (b=x)\to (a=x)\Big)\to (a=b)
\end{equation*}
given by $\lam{f} f(b,\refl{b})$, for every $b:A$. Note that any family of maps $\prd{x:A}(b=x)\to (a=x)$ induces an equivalence of total spaces by \cref{ex:contr_equiv}, since their total spaces are are both contractible by \cref{cor:contr_path}. It follows that we have an equivalence
\begin{equation*}
\varphi_b:\Big(\prd{x:A} \eqv{(b=x)}{(a=x)}\Big)\to (a=b)
\end{equation*}
given by $\lam{f} f(b,\refl{b})$, for every $b:A$. 

Note that $\varphi_a(\lam{x}\idfunc[(a=x)])\jdeq\refl{a}$. Therefore it follows by another application of \cref{thm:yoneda} that the unique family of maps 
\begin{equation*}
\alpha_b:(a=b)\to \Big(\prd{x:A} \eqv{(b=x)}{(a=x)}\Big)
\end{equation*}
that satisfies $\alpha_a(\refl{a})=\lam{x}\idfunc[(a=x)]$ is a family of sections of $\varphi$. 
It follows that $\alpha$ is a family of equivalences. Now the proof is completed by reverting the direction of the family of equivalences in the codomain.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The universal property of set quotients}

The quotient $A/R$ is constructed as the image of $R$, so we obtain a commuting triangle
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=-1em]
    A \arrow[rr,"q_R"] \arrow[dr,swap,"R"] & & A/R \arrow[dl,hook,"i_R"] \\
    \phantom{A/R} & \prop^A,
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
and the embedding $i_R:A/R\to\prop^A$ satisfies the universal property of the image of $R$. This universal property is, however, not the usual universal property of the quotient.

\begin{defn}
  Consider a map $q:A\to B$ into a set $B$ satisfying the property that $f(x)=f(y)$ whenever $R(x,y)$ holds. We say that $q$ satisfies the \define{universal property of the set quotient by $R$} if for every map $f:A\to X$ into a set $X$ such that $f(x)=f(y)$ whenever $R(x,y)$ holds, there is a unique extension
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      A \arrow[d,swap,"q"] \arrow[dr,"f"] \\
      B \arrow[r,densely dotted] & X.
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
\end{defn}

\begin{rmk}
  Formally, we express the universal property of the quotient by $R$ as follows. Consider a map $q:A\to B$ that satisfies the property that
  \begin{equation*}
    H:\prd{x,y:A}R(x,y)\to (f(x)=f(y)).
  \end{equation*}
  Then there is for any set $X$ a map
  \begin{equation*}
    q^\ast:(B\to X) \to \Big(\sm{f:A\to X}\prd{x,y:A}R(x,y)\to (f(x)=f(y))\Big).
  \end{equation*}
  This map takes a function $h:B\to X$ to the pair
  \begin{equation*}
    q^\ast(h)\defeq(h\circ q,\lam{x}{y}{r}\ap{h}{H_{x,y}(r)}).
  \end{equation*}
  The universal property of the set quotient of $R$ asserts that the map $q^\ast$ is an equivalence for every set $X$. It is important to note that the universal property of set quotients is formulated with respect to sets.
\end{rmk}

\begin{thm}\label{thm:quotient_up}
  Let $R:A\to (A\to \prop)$ be an equivalence relation\index{equivalence relation}, and consider a map $q:A\to B$ into a set $B$. Then the following are equivalent.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The map $q$ satisfies the property that
    \begin{equation*}
      q(x)=q(y)
    \end{equation*}
    for every $x,y:A$ for which $R(x,y)$ holds, and moreover $q$ satisfies the universal property of the set quotient of $R$.
  \item The map $q$ is surjective and \define{effective}, which means that for each $x,y:A$ we have an equivalence
    \begin{equation*}
      (q(x)=q(y))\simeq R(x,y).
    \end{equation*}
  \item The map $R:A\to (A\to \prop)$ extends along $q$ to an embedding
    \begin{equation*}
      \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=tiny]
        A \arrow[rr,"q"] \arrow[dr,swap,"R"] & & B \arrow[dl,densely dotted,"i"] \\
        & \prop^A
      \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation*}
    and the embedding $i$ satisfies the universal property of the image inclusion of $R$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  We first show that (ii) is equivalent to (iii), since this is the easiest part. After that, we will show that (i) is equivalent to (ii).

  Assume that (ii) holds. Then $q$ is surjective by \cref{thm:surjective}. Moreover, we have
  \begin{align*}
    R(x,y) & \simeq R(x)=R(y) \\
           & \simeq i(q(x))=i(q(y)) \\
           & \simeq q(x)=q(y)
  \end{align*}
  In this calculation, the first equivalence holds by \cref{cor:eq-quotient}; the second equivalence holds since we have a homotopy $R\htpy i\circ q$; and the third equivalence holds since $i$ is an embedding. This completes the proof that (ii) implies (iii).

  Next, we show that (iii) implies (ii). Assuming (iii), we define a map
  \begin{equation*}
    i:B\to\prop^A
  \end{equation*}
  by $i(b,a)\defeq b=q(a)$. Then the triangle
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=tiny]
      A \arrow[rr,"q"] \arrow[dr,swap,"R"] & & B \arrow[dl,"i"] \\
      & \prop^A
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  commutes, since we have an equivalence
  \begin{align*}
    i(q(a),a') & \simeq R(a,a')
  \end{align*}
  for each $a,a':A$. To show that $i$ is an embedding, it suffices to show that $i$ is injective, i.e., that
  \begin{equation*}
    \prd{b,b':B}(i(b)=i(b'))\to (b=b')
  \end{equation*}
  Note that this is a property, and that $q$ is assumed to be surjective. Hence by \cref{prp:surjective} it is equivalent to show that
  \begin{equation*}
    \prd{a,a':A}(i(q(a))=i(q(a')))\to (q(a)=q(a')).
  \end{equation*}
  Since $R\htpy i\circ q$, and $q(a)=q(a')$ is assumed to be equivalent to $R(a,a')$, it suffices to show that
  \begin{equation*}
    \prd{a,a':A}(R(a)=R(a'))\to R(a,a'),
  \end{equation*}
  which follows directly from \cref{cor:eq-quotient}. Thus we have shown that the factorization $R\htpy i\circ q$ factors $R$ as a surjective map followed by an injective map. We conclude by \cref{thm:surjective} that the embedding $i$ satisfies the universal property of the image factorization of $R$, which finishes the proof that (iii) implies (ii).
  
  Now we show that (i) implies (ii). To see that $q$ is surjective if it satisfies the assumptions in (i), consider the image factorization
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=tiny]
      A \arrow[dr,swap,"q"] \arrow[rr,"q_q"] & & \im(q) \arrow[dl,"i_q"] \\
      \phantom{\im(q)} & B.
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  We claim that the map $i_q$ has a section. To see this, we first note that we have
  \begin{equation*}
    q_q(x)=q_q(y)
  \end{equation*}
  for any $x,y:A$ satisfying $R(x,y)$, because if $R(x,y)$ holds, then $q(x)=q(y)$ and hence $i_q(q_q(x))=i_q(q_q(y))$ holds and $i_q$ is an embedding. Since $\im(q)$ is a set, we may apply the universal property of $q$ and we obtain a unique extension of $q_q$ along $q$
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      A \arrow[d,swap,"q"] \arrow[dr,"q_q"] \\
      B \arrow[r,densely dotted,swap,"h"] & \im(q).
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  Now we observe that the composite $i_q\circ h$ is an extension of $q$ along $q$, so it must be the identity function by uniqueness. Thus we have established that $h$ is a section of $i_q$. Now it follows from the fact that $i_q$ is an embedding with a section, that $i_q$ is an equivalence. We conclude that $q$ is surjective, because $q$ is the composite $i_q\circ q_q$ of a surjective map followed by an equivalence.

  Now we have to show that $q(x)=q(y)$ is equivalent to $R(x,y)$. We first apply the universal property of $q$ to obtain for each $x:A$ an extension of $R(x)$ along $q$
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      A \arrow[d,swap,"q"] \arrow[dr,"R(x)"] \\
      B \arrow[r,densely dotted,swap,"\tilde{R}(x)"] & \prop.
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  Since the triangle commutes, we have an equivalence $\tilde{R}(x,q(x'))\simeq R(x,x')$ for each $x':A$. Now we apply \cref{thm:id_fundamental} to see that the canonical family of maps
  \begin{equation*}
    \prd{y:B}(q(x)=y)\to \tilde{R}(x,y)
  \end{equation*}
  is a family of equivalences. Thus, we need to show that the type $\sm{y:B}\tilde{R}(x,y)$ is contractible. For the center of contraction, note that we have $q(x):B$, and the type $\tilde{R}(x,q(x))$ is equivalent to the type $R(x,x)$, which is inhabited by reflexivity of $R$. To construct the contraction, it suffices to show that
  \begin{equation*}
    \prd{y:B}\tilde{R}(x,y)\to (q(x)=y).
  \end{equation*}
  Since this is a property, and since we have already shown that $q$ is a surjective map, we may apply \cref{prp:surjective}, by which it suffices to show that
  \begin{equation*}
    \prd{x':A}\tilde{R}(x,q(x'))\to (q(x)=q(x')).
  \end{equation*}
  Since $\tilde{R}(x,q(x'))\simeq R(x,x')$, this is immediate from our assumption on $q$. Thus we obtain the contraction, and we conclude that we have an equivalence $\tilde{R}(x,y)\simeq (q(x)=y)$ for each $y:B$. It follows that we have an equivalence
  \begin{equation*}
    R(x,y)\simeq (q(x)=q(y))
  \end{equation*}
  for each $x,y:A$, which completes the proof that (i) implies (ii).
  
  It remains to show that (iii) implies (i). Assume (iii), and let $f:A\to X$ be a map into a set $X$, satisfying the property that
  \begin{equation*}
    \prd{a,a':A}R(a,a')\to (f(a)=f(a')).
  \end{equation*}
  Our goal is to show that the type of extensions of $f$ along $q$ is contractible. By \cref{ex:surjective-precomp} it follows that there is at most one such an extension, so it suffices to construct one.

  In order to construct an extension, we will construct for every $b:B$ a term $x:X$ satisfying the property
  \begin{equation*}
    P(x)\defeq \exists_{(a:A)}(f(a)=x)\land (q(a)=b).
  \end{equation*}
  Before we make this construction, we first observe that there is at most one such $x$, i.e., that the type of $x:X$ satisfying $P(x)$ is in fact a proposition. To see this, we need to show that $x=x'$ for any $x,x':X$ satisfying $P(x)$ and $P(x')$. Since $X$ is assumed to be a set, our goal of showing that $x=x'$ is a property. Therefore we may assume that we have $a,a':A$ satisfying
  \begin{align*}
    f(a) & = x & q(a) & = b \\
    f(a') & = x' & q(a') & = b.
  \end{align*}
  It follows from these assumptions that $q(a)=q(a')$, and hence that $R(a,a')$ holds. This in turn implies that $f(a)=f(a')$, and hence that $x=x'$.

  Now let $b:B$. Our goal is to construct an $x:X$ that satisfies the property
  \begin{equation*}
    \exists_{(a:A)}(f(a)=x)\land (q(a)=b).
  \end{equation*}
  Since $q$ is assumed to be surjective, we have $\brck{\fib{q}{b}}$. Moreover, since we have shown that at most one $x:X$ exists with the asserted property, we get to assume that we have $a:A$ satisfying $q(a)=b$. Now we see that $x\defeq f(a)$ satisfies the desired property.

  Thus, we obtain a function $h:B\to X$ satisfying the property that for all $b:B$ there exists an $a:A$ such that
  \begin{equation*}
    f(a)=h(b)\qquad\text{and}\qquad q(a)=b.
  \end{equation*}
  In particular, it follows that $h(q(a))=f(a)$ for all $a:A$, which completes the proof that (ii) implies (i).  
\end{proof}

\subsection{The rational numbers}

\subsection{Set truncation}\label{sec:set-truncation}

\begin{lem}
For each type $A$, the relation $I_{(-1)}:A\to (A\to\prop)$ given by
\begin{equation*}
I_{(-1)}(x,y)\defeq\brck{x=y}
\end{equation*}
is an equivalence relation.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
For every $x:A$ we have $\bproj{\refl{x}}:\brck{x=x}$, so the relation is reflexive. To see that the relation is symmetric note that by the universal property of propositional truncation there is a unique map $\brck{\invfunc}:\brck{x=y}\to\brck{y=x}$ for which the square
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}
(x=y) \arrow[r,"\invfunc"] \arrow[d,swap,"\bproj{\blank}"] & (y=x) \arrow[d,"\bproj{\blank}"] \\
\brck{x=y} \arrow[r,densely dotted,swap,"\brck{\invfunc}"] & \brck{y=x}
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
commutes. This shows that the relation is symmetric. Similarly, we show by the universal property of propositional truncation that the relation is transitive.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
For each type $A$ we define the \define{set truncation}
\begin{equation*}
\trunc{0}{A}\defeq A/I_{(-1)},
\end{equation*}
and the unit of the set truncation is defined to be the quotient map.
\end{defn}

\begin{comment}
\begin{thm}\label{thm:fam_proj}
For any small type $A:\UU$ there is an equivalence
\begin{equation*}
\mathsf{map\usc{}fam}_A:\eqv{(A\to \UU)}{\Big(\sm{X:\UU} X\to A\Big)}.
\end{equation*}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Note that we have the function
\begin{equation*}
\varphi :\lam{B} \Big(\sm{x:A}B(x),\proj 1\Big) : (A\to \UU)\to \Big(\sm{X:\UU}X\to A\Big).
\end{equation*}
The fiber of this map at $(X,f)$ is by univalence and function extensionality equivalent to the type
\begin{equation*}
\sm{B:A\to \UU}{e:\eqv{(\sm{x:A}B(x))}{X}} \proj 1\htpy f\circ e.
\end{equation*}
By \cref{ex:triangle_fib} this type is equivalent to the type
\begin{equation*}
\sm{B:A\to \UU}\prd{a:A} \eqv{B(a)}{\fib{f}{a}},
\end{equation*}
and by `type theoretic choice', which was established in \cref{thm:choice}, this type is equivalent to
\begin{equation*}
\prd{a:A}\sm{X:\UU}\eqv{X}{\fib{f}{a}}.
\end{equation*}
We conclude that the fiber of $\varphi$ at $(X,f)$ is equivalent to the type $\mathsf{ess\usc{}small}(f)$. However, since $f:X\to A$ is a map between small types it is essentially small. Moreover, since being essentially small is a proposition by \cref{lem:isprop_ess_small}, it follows that $\fib{\varphi}{(X,f)}$ is contractible for every $f:X\to A$. In other words, $\varphi$ is a contractible map, and therefore it is an equivalence.
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}
The inverse of the map
\begin{equation*}
\varphi : (A\to \UU)\to \Big(\sm{X:\UU}X\to A\Big).
\end{equation*}
constructed in \cref{thm:fam_proj} is the map $(X,f)\mapsto \fibf{f}$.
\end{rmk}

\begin{thm}\label{thm:classifier}
Let $f:A\to B$ be a map. Then there is an equivalence
\begin{equation*}
\eqv{\mathsf{ess\usc{}small}(f)}{\mathsf{is\usc{}classified}(f)},
\end{equation*}
where $\mathsf{is\usc{}classified}(f)$\index{is_classified(f)@{$\mathsf{is\usc{}classified}(f)$}} is the type of quadruples $(F,\tilde{F},H,p)$ consisting of maps
$F:B\to \UU$ and $\tilde{F}:A\to \sm{X:\UU}X$, a homotopy $H:F\circ f\htpy \proj 1\circ \tilde{F}$,  such that the commuting square
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}
A \arrow[r,"\tilde{F}"] \arrow[d,swap,"f"] & \sm{X:\UU}X \arrow[d,"\proj 1"] \\
B \arrow[r,swap,"F"] & \UU
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
is a pullback square, as witnessed by $p$\footnote{The universal property of the pullback is not expressible by a type. However, we may take the type of $p:\isequiv(h)$, where $h:A\to B\times_\UU\big(\sm{X:\UU}X\big)$ is the map obtained by the universal property of the canonical pullback.}. If $f$ comes equipped with a term of type $\mathsf{is\usc{}classified}(f)$, we also say that $f$ is \define{classified}\index{classified by the universal family} by the universal family. 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
From \cref{ex:sq_fib} we obtain that the type of pairs $(\tilde{F},H)$ is equivalent to the type of fiberwise transformations
\begin{equation*}
\prd{b:B}\fib{f}{b}\to F(b).
\end{equation*}
By \cref{cor:pb_fibequiv} the square is a pullback square if and only if the induced map
\begin{equation*}
\prd{b:B}\fib{f}{b}\to F(b)
\end{equation*}
is a fiberwise equivalence. Thus the data $(F,\tilde{F},H,pb)$ is equivalent to the type of pairs $(F,e)$ where $e$ is a fiberwise equivalence from $\fibf{f}$ to $F$. By \cref{thm:choice} the type of pairs $(F,e)$ is equivalent to the type $\mathsf{ess\usc{}small}(f)$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}
For any type $A$ (not necessarily small), and any $B:A\to \UU$, the square\index{Sigma-type@{$\Sigma$-type}!as pullback of universal family}
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=6em]
\sm{x:A}B(x) \arrow[d,swap,"\proj 1"] \arrow[r,"{\lam{(x,y)}(B(x),y)}"] & \sm{X:\UU}X \arrow[d,"\proj 1"] \\
A \arrow[r,swap,"B"] & \UU
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
is a pullback square. Therefore it follows that for any family $B:A\to\UU$ of small types, the projection map $\proj 1:\sm{x:A}B(x)\to A$ is an essentially small map.
To see that the claim is a direct consequence of \cref{lem:pb_subst} we write the asserted square in its rudimentary form:
\begin{equation*}
%\begin{gathered}[b]
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=6em]
\sm{x:A}\mathrm{El}(B(x)) \arrow[d,swap,"\proj 1"] \arrow[r,"{\lam{(x,y)}(B(x),y)}"] & \sm{X:\UU}\mathrm{El}(X) \arrow[d,"\proj 1"] \\
A \arrow[r,swap,"B"] & \UU.
\end{tikzcd}%\\[-\dp\strutbox]\end{gathered}\qedhere
\end{equation*}
\end{rmk}

In the following theorem we show that a type is locally small if and only if its diagonal is classified by $\UU$.

\begin{thm}
Let $A$ be a type. The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $A$ is locally small.\index{locally small}
\item There are maps $I:A\times A\to\UU$ and $\tilde{I}:A\to\sm{X:\UU}X$, and a homotopy $H:I\circ \delta_A\htpy \proj 1\circ\tilde{I}$
such that the commuting square
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}
A \arrow[r,"\tilde{I}"] \arrow[d,swap,"\delta_A"] & \sm{X:\UU}X \arrow[d,"\proj 1"] \\
A\times A \arrow[r,swap,"{I}"] & \UU
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
is a pullback square.\index{diagonal!of a type}
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
In \cref{ex:diagonal} we have established that the identity type $x=y$ is the fiber of $\delta_A$ at $(x,y):A\times A$. Therefore it follows that $A$ is locally small if and only if the diagonal $\delta_A$ is essentially small.
Now the result follows from \cref{thm:classifier}.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Univalent universes are object classifiers}

\begin{defn}
  Consider a map $p:E\to B$ and a map $f:X\to Y$. The type $\cart(f,p)$ of \define{cartesian morphisms} from $f$ to $p$ is the type of quadruples $(g,h,H,t)$ consisting of maps
  \begin{align*}
    g & : Y\to B \\
    h & : X\to E,
  \end{align*}
  a homotopy $H:g\circ f\htpy p\circ h$, and a term $t$ witnessing that the commuting square
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      X \arrow[r,"h"] \arrow[d,swap,"f"] & E \arrow[d,"p"] \\
      Y \arrow[r,swap,"g"] & B
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  is a pullback square.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
  A map $p:E\to B$ is called an \define{object classifier} if for every map $f:X\to Y$, the type $\cart(f,p)$ of cartesian morphisms
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      X \arrow[r] \arrow[d,swap,"f"] & E \arrow[d,"p"] \\
      Y \arrow[r] & B
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  from $f$ to $p$ is a proposition. 
\end{defn}

\begin{prp}
  Consider a map $p:E\to B$. The following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The map $p$ is an object classifier.
  \item The function
    \begin{equation*}
      \tr_{\fibf{p}}:(x=y)\to (\fib{p}{x}\simeq\fib{p}{y})
    \end{equation*}
    is an equivalence.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{prp}

\begin{cor}
  A universe is an object classifier if and only if it is univalent.
