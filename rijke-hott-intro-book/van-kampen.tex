\chapter{The Seifert-Van Kampen theorem}

\begin{thm}
Suppose
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}
S \arrow[r,"g"] \arrow[d,swap,"f"] & B \arrow[d,"j"] \\
A \arrow[r,swap,"i"] & X
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
is a cocartesian square, in which $S$, $A$, and $B$ are assumed to be $0$-connected. Then 
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}
\pi_1(S) \arrow[r,"g"] \arrow[d,swap,"f"] & \pi_1(B) \arrow[d,"j"] \\
\pi_1(A) \arrow[r,swap,"i"] & \pi_1(X)
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
is a pushout square of groups.
\end{thm}
