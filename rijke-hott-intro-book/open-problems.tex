\chapter{Open problems in homotopy type theory}
We list only the open problems of synthetic homotopy theory, omitting the open problems related to the semantics of homotopy type theory.
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute the homotopy groups of the spheres.
\item Define the Grassmannians.
\item Prove Freyd's generating hypothesis
\item Hurewicz theorem
\item Barratt-Priddy theorem
\item (Semi-)simplicial types.
\item Ring structure on the sphere spectrum
\item Higher Van Kampen theorems
\item Higher Blakers-Massey theorems
\item Find a delooping of $\sphere{3}$, and define the octonionic Hopf fibration.
\end{itemize}
