\chapter{Overview of the axioms in this book}

\begin{enumerate}
\item We assumed the function extensionality axiom in \cref{axiom:funext}. Function extensionality was later derived from the univalence axiom in \cref{thm:funext-univalence}.
\item We assumed the univalence axiom in \cref{axiom:univalence}.
\item We assumed that universes are closed under propositional truncations in \cref{axiom:propositional-truncations}. It was shown in \cref{thm:join-construction-propositional-truncations} that any universe that is closed under homotopy pushouts is also closed under propositional truncations.
\item We assumed the type theoretic replacement axiom in \cref{axiom:replacement}. It was shown in \cref{thm:replacement} that replacement holds for any universe that is closed under homotopy pushouts.
\item We assumed in \cref{axiom:circle} that the circle is a type in the base universe $\UU_0$. In \cref{thm:circle-replacement} the circle was shown to be a type in the base universe using the replacement axiom. It was shown that the In \cref{thm:circle-pushout}, the circle was constructed as a pushout.
\item In \cref{axiom:pushouts} that universes are closed under pushouts.
