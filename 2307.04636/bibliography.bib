  abstract = {Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative is about pictures of verbs, the representation of mechanism and motion, process and dynamics, causes and effects, explanation and narrative. Practical applications and examples include statistical graphics, charts for making important decisions in engineering and medicine, technical manuals, diagrams, design of computer interfaces and websites and on-line manuals, animations and scientific visualizations, techniques for talks, and design strategies for enhancing the rate of information transfer in print, presentations, and computer screens. The use of visual evidence in deciding to launch the space shuttle Challenger is discussed in careful detail. Video snapshots show redesigns of a supercomputer animation of a thunderstorm. The book is designed and printed to the highest standards, with luscious color throughout and four built-in flaps for showing motion and before/after effects.},

  abstract = {Science and art have in common intense seeing, the wide-eyed observing that generates empirical information. Beautiful Evidence is about how seeing turns into showing, how empirical observations turn into explanations and evidence presentations. The book identifies excellent and effective methods for presenting information, suggests new designs, and provides tools for assessing the credibility of evidence presentations.Here we will see many close readings of serious evidence presentations-ranging through evolutionary trees and rocket science to economics, art history, and sculpture. Insistent application of the principles of analytical thinking helps both insiders and outsiders assess the credibility of evidence.},

    publisher = {Oxford University Press},
    year = {2017},
    month = {12},
    abstract = "{This book is devoted to a general study of geometric theories from a topos-theoretic perspective. After recalling the necessary topos-theoretic preliminaries, it presents the main methodology it uses to extract ‘concrete’ information on theories from properties of their classifying toposes—the ‘bridge’ technique. As a first implementation of this methodology, a duality is established between the subtoposes of the classifying topos of a geometric theory and the geometric theory extensions (also called ‘quotients’) of the theory. Many concepts of elementary topos theory which apply to the lattice of subtoposes of a given topos are then transferred via this duality into the context of geometric theories. A second very general implementation of the ‘bridge’ technique is the investigation of the class of theories of presheaf type (i.e. classified by a presheaf topos). After establishing a number of preliminary results on flat functors in relation to classifying toposes, the book carries out a systematic investigation of this class resulting in a number of general results and a characterization theorem allowing one to test whether a given theory is of presheaf type by considering its models in arbitrary Grothendieck toposes. Expansions of geometric theories and faithful interpretations of theories of presheaf type are also investigated. As geometric theories can always be written (in many ways) as quotients of presheaf type theories, the study of quotients of a given theory of presheaf type is undertaken. Lastly, the book presents a number of applications in different fields of mathematics of the theory it develops.}",
