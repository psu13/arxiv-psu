\subsection{\label{subselpac}Selected packages}
%
We will start with the description of the {\tt FORM} programs {\tt
  MATAD} and {\tt MINCER}.  Details on the automatic application of
asymptotic expansions using {\tt LMP} and {\tt EXP} are given in
Section~\ref{subsubexplmp}.  In Section~\ref{subgeficom} the package
{\tt GEFICOM} will be explained. The way the generator {\tt QGRAF} works
should also become clear then, which is why it will not be described
separately.  The subsequent section is devoted to the {\tt Mathematica}
packages {\tt FeynArts}, {\tt FeynCalc}, {\tt FormCalc}, {\tt TwoCalc}
and {\tt LoopTools}.  In the concluding section we discuss the package
{\tt CompHEP} as an application of automated multi-leg computations.
