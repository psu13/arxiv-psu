\maketitle

% ABSTRACT
% CT papers must include an abstract. The abstract should consist of a
% succinct statement of background followed by a listing of the
% principal new results that are to be found in the paper. The abstract
% should be informative, clear, and as complete as possible. Phrases
% like "we investigate..." or "we study..." should be kept to a minimum
% in favor of "we prove that..."  or "we show that...".  Do not
% include equation numbers, unexpanded citations (such as "[23]"), or
% any other references to things in the paper that are not defined in
% the abstract. The abstract may be distributed without the rest of the
% paper so it must be entirely self-contained.  Try to include all words
% and phrases that someone might search for when looking for your paper.
% You can use some basic LaTeX commands in the abstract, but not any
% user defined macros. 

\begin{abstract}
  A longstanding open problem asks for an aperiodic monotile, also known
  as an ``einstein'': a shape 
  that admits tilings of the plane, but never periodic tilings.
  We answer this problem for topological disk tiles by exhibiting a continuum of 
  combinatorially equivalent aperiodic polygons.
  We first show that a representative example, the ``hat''
  polykite, can form clusters called ``metatiles'', for which substitution
  rules can be defined.  Because the metatiles admit tilings of
  the plane, so too does the hat.  We then prove that generic members
  of our continuum of polygons are aperiodic, through a new kind of
  geometric incommensurability argument.  Separately, we give a combinatorial,
  computer-assisted proof that the hat must form hierarchical---and hence
  aperiodic---tilings.  
\end{abstract}

\section*{Acknowledgements}
\label{sec:acks}

Thanks to Ava Pun for her work on software for computing Heesch numbers
and displaying patches.  Thanks also to Jaap Scherphuis for creating a
number of useful free software tools for exploring tilings.  These tools
all played a crucial role in the explorations that led to the discovery of
our polykite.
