\chapter*{Preface}

This book started as a set of lecture notes for an Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory course that I taught at Carnegie Mellon University in the spring of 2018. The goal of that course was to give students from a wide variety of backgrounds, including mathematics, computer science, and philosophy majors, a solid foundational understanding of what univalent mathematics is about, and that is also the purpose of this book.

This book would not exist without the consistent and generous support of three people: Steve Awodey, Dan Grayson, and Andrej Bauer. Back in 2017, Steve proposed that I would teach an introductory course to homotopy type theory at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was a PhD student at the time. When the course was finished he took the course notes to Cambridge University Press to propose a book project. Throughout the entire process of writing this book I have relied on Steve's advice, and I owe him a big univalent thanks. After my graduation from CMU, I held a postdoc position at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where Dan Grayson was my mentor. The formalization project of the book started to take off during this year, and the book has benefited from many enjoyable discussions with Dan about writing, about formalization, and univalent mathematics, and his support extended much beyond the book project. After one year in Illinois I moved to Ljubljana, where Andrej generously offered me a stable, multiple year postdoc position. What once was a set of course notes now transformed into a textbook, and some of the clearest explanations on how to think in type theory and how to define concepts correctly have their origin in the many conversations with Andrej. I cannot thank you enough.

Furthermore, this book project has benefited from insightful discussions and many people using an early version of this book. I would like to thank
