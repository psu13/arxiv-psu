\chapter{The circle}\label{chapter-synthetic-homotopy-theory}

Many spaces familiar from classical topology have a counterpart in homotopy type theory. For example, there are types representing spheres, projective spaces, and many other CW-complexes. Often such types are constructed as \emph{higher inductive types}. The study of such types leads to the subject of \emph{synthetic homotopy theory}. We conclude this book with a short window into this exciting new subject by introducing the circle as a higher inductive type.

We have seen many examples of inductive types. Those are specified by their (point) constructors, which tell us how we can construct their elements, and an induction principle that allows us to construct sections of type families over them. Inductive types are freely generated by their constructors. Higher inductive types are specified not only by their point constructors, but also by \emph{path constructors}, which are identifications between the point constructors.

The presence of path constructors in a higher inductive type make it slightly more complicated to specify its induction principle. With ordinary inductive types the induction principle only took the point constructors into account. However, when we specify a higher inductive type, we also have to take the path constructors into account. We will see how this works in the example of the circle.

Univalence has a prominent role in the study of higher inductive types. In particular, when we want to characterize the identity type of a higher inductive type we will have to construct a type family over that higher inductive type using the induction principle. Any type family over a higher inductive type must be compatible with the path constructors, and this is where univalence comes in.

The prime example of a type family constructed over a higher inductive type using the univalence axiom is the \emph{universal cover} of the circle. We will see how the univalence axiom can be used to construct the universal cover, and how the universal cover can be used to construct the famous identification
\begin{equation*}
  \pi_1(\sphere{1})=\Z
\end{equation*}
in the type of groups, which asserts that the fundamental group of the circle is the group of integers.
