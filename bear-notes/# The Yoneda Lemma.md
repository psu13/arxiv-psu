# # The Yoneda Lemma

This result is really about categories of functors. Which is pretty meta

This formulation uses the [A,B] notation for the category of functions. Smith and Perone do this too.

Strom (gsm127): this one is weird because the shape looks wrong. But here mor_c(A,X) is one result from C(A,-) in the other formulations?

makes this clear... the star maps are pre and post composition, just like everyone else.
