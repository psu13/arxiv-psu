FAURÉ: Cantique de Jean Racine PSO Premiere 
BRAHMS: Schicksalslied

Jeremy did not like the concerto performance. He has a more jaded pov.

**Saturday Jan. 18, 2025. Cleveland Orchestra**
Elim Chan, Augustin Hadelich
Brahms -  Vln CTO
Lutosławski - Concerto For Orchestra

Very good. Hadelich is even better at the Brahms than before. Which is astounding. They also kept the program short, which I liked.

Nice hall. Decent access. Try dress circle next time because they let the chairs up there.
Short program! Big crowd. Vibe was that this is more normal than in PGH.

**Saturday, Jan 25. CMU Contemp. Ensemble**

Viola trio was nice!
All the larger ensemble stuff was good too, if not astoudning.

**Friday, Jan. 31, 2025 at 7:30 P.M. Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025 at 2:30 P.M.**

Manfred Honeck, conductor Maria Dueñas, violin
CARLOS SIMON: Four Black American Dances PSO Premiere
SAINT-SAËNS: Violin Concerto No. 3 
DVOŘÁK: Symphony No. 9, “From theNew World

The Simon was interesting and fun. Saint-Saens was fine. Hard to judge.
Dvorak was strong but perhaps a little self concious with some overemphasis of the big moments.
Good solos though.

**Thursday, Feb 27. CMU Phil 8pm Carnegie Music Hall**
Composer's concert - fine
Berlioz Fantastique - very good

**Friday, Mar. 7, 2025 at 7:30 P.M.**

NINA SHEKHAR: Lumina PSO Premiere 
SHOSTAKOVICH: Cello Concerto No. 1 
STRAUSS: Don Juan
STRAUSS: Suite from Arabella
World Premiere & Commission

The Shosty was great. The bookends were "fine", the premiere being more interesting than the suite. Don Juan was Don Juan.
Encore for the concerto was Sam Cooke, I think.

**Friday, Mar. 28, 2025 at 7:30 P.M. Saturday, Mar. 29, 2025 at 7:30 P.M. Sunday, Mar. 30, 2025 at 2:30 P.M.**

Great beat drop in the first (?) movement.

**CMU Chamber Tuesday 4/1**

Schumann Piano Quartet - Good.
Schubert String Quintet in C - Amaaazing. Maybe the best thing this year.

**CMU Phil Wed. 4/2**

Opera Gala - very opera. Good singing.

**Pink Talking Fish - 4/5**

Chocolate Drops reunion - 💯🎉💯

**CMU Phil Wed. 4/28**

Good show, big sound. The concerto was very polished for a student piece. Everything else was too long and samey.

**Yo-Yo Ma, PSO 6/5**

Good show. Maybe hokey. Probably not.
Stupendous lyricism and collaborative spirit.
Stole Annie's Cello for the Bach encore.

Manfred Honeck, conductor Beatrice Rana, piano
LERA AUERBACH: New Work World Premiere & Commission
MENDELSSOHN: Piano Concerto No. 1

banger after banger.
The second movement of the Shostakovich 10th Symphony is an all time classical beat drop/LET'S FUCKING GO moment.

Rana is really good.
