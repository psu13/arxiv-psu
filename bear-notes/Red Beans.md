# Red Beans

Ingredients:
 
1 pound red kidney beans
3-4 large ham shanks (3-3.5 pounds-ish total)
2 1/2 cups chopped celery
2 cups diced sweet onion
2 cups diced red or green bell pepper
5 bay leaves
2 teaspoons white pepper
2 teaspoons dried thyme leaves
1 1/2 teaspoons granulated garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon Tabasco
 
Optional
1 pound Andouille, sliced to make large chunks
 
Rice to serve the dish on.
 
8 to 10 quart heavy pot
 
Directions:
 
Naturally, you need to soak the beans covered with water in a bowl for at least 6-8 hours. I usually start soaking the night before with about 2 inches of water over the beans. This will generally give you beans just barely covered with water the next day.
 
Use a sharp knife to slice a slit around the shanks about every 2 inches. This lets the stock develop better and makes pulling the meat off the bones a little easier later. Put the shanks in the pot, add just enough water to cover them and bring to a low boil. Add the celery, onion and bell pepper and the spices except for the Tabasco. Reduce heat to a consistent simmer.
 
Simmer the shanks until they are 'fork tender'. More or less this is a point where it'd be pretty easy to get the ham off the bones - between one and 1 1/2 hours. Remove the shanks from the pot and place them on a plate to cool. Drain the majority of the soak water off the beans and add to the pot, returning to a good simmer.
 
Once the shanks are cool enough to handle, pull the meat off the bones with your hands, working into bite sized pieces and cutting as necessary. Add the meat back to the pot and cook until the beans start to break up - this will be about an hour from where you added the beans.
 
Once the beans begin to break up, you'll want to add the sausage cut into convenient size if you are going to use it. Also add the tablespoon of Tabasco at this point.
 
Depending on the liquid content of the dish at this point you will want to watch closely to make sure that
the beans don’t scorch. Once the beans are done you're pretty much ready to serve. This makes a lot of food. Makes very good leftovers and freezes quite well. I prefer mine to be closer to a chili in consistency but I Have Been Informed that the real thing is more like a medium soup with a lot of stuff in it
