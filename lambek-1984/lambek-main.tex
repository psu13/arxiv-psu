\section{Introduction}

It has become clear for some time that categorists and logicians have been
doing the same thing under different names. This situation is strikingly
illustrated in higher order logic, where the connections are particularly
illuminating. In this article we briefly survey portions of our forthcoming
book [LS6], to which the reader is referred for more details.

Systems of higher order logic have been studied for a long time. We have
in mind logical systems in which variables and quantifiers range over functions
(as in the $\l$-calculus) or elements and subsets of given sets (as in type
theory), not just over individuals (as in first order logic). Higher order
concepts naturally occur in mathematics: algebraists quantify over ideals,
topologists over open sets and analysts over functions. Yet, in spite of its
expressive advantage, higher order logic never achieved the popularity of first
order logic. Perhaps its proof theory and model theory were deemed to be too
hard.

Thus, after the monumental work in type theory by Russell and Whitehead
(Principia Mathematica, 1908), there are only sporadic important contributions
to the literature. G\"{o}del (1931) established his incompleteness theorem for
type theory and related systems, Church (1940) combined $\l$-calculus with type
theory, Henkin (1949) discussed models for type theory and, more recently,
Abraham Robinson (1964) used type theory in his book ``Nonstandard Analysis'',
a lead not continued by his followers. Let us also mention that type theories
have recently become important in computer science.

Theories of functionality, namely $\l$-calculi, have fared somewhat better.
After pioneering work by Sch\"onfinkel, Curry, Church and Rosser in the 1920's
and 30's, these systems had a small but devoted following. In the late 60's,
an explosion of activity surrounding the models of Dana Scott (1971) and concomitant
work in computer science revived interest in them.

Meanwhile, the categorical side saw rapid development. The ready accept-
ance of category theory as a working language in many areas of mathematics
foreshadowed its introduction into logic and foundations. Nevertheless, it
came as a surprise to many people when, in the 1960's, Lawvere (1969, 1970) and
one of the present authors [L1] pointed out some remarkable connections between
category theory and logic. Indeed, after -the discovery of elementary toposes
by Lawvere and Tierney (1970), the field of "categorical logic" underwent
intense development. The reader is referred to the survey article by Kock and
Reyes (1977) and the monograph by Makkai and Reyes (1977).

The situation in higher order logic, as far as it is treated in our book,
is summarized as follows:

\medskip
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c | c }
 \hline
Logic & Algebra \\
 \hline
 untyped $\l$-calculus & C-monoids \\
 typed $\l$-calculus & cartesian closed categories \\
 type theory & toposes \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\medskip

\noindent
Indeed, we shall see that each side, when suitably formulated, gives rise to a
category. Moreover, the comparison between the two sides is mediated by
functors which set up an equivalence or adjointness. In the meantime, Robert
Seely, has found another such comparison:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c | c }
 \hline
Logic & Algebra \\
 \hline
Martin-L\"of type theory  & locally cartesian closed categories \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\medskip

\noindent
Undoubtedly, there are many other such situations. For example, it would be
interesting to pinpoint the logical equivalent of cartesian closed categories
with equalizers.

\section{Cartesian closed categories and typed $\l$-calculi}

Cartesian closed categories are becoming increasingly important in many
branches of mathematics. Indeed, as we shall see, in logic they play a fundamental
role.

A {\em cartesian closed category} is a category $\C$ with (canonical) finite
products and exponentiation. This means that $\C$ has a terminal object $\one$ and
objects $A \times B$ and $\fexp{B}{A}$, for all $A,B$ in $\C$, together
with natural isomorphisms:

\bes
\Hom(C ,A) \times \Hom(C ,B)  \Hom(C ,A \times B) ,
\tag{a}
\ees
