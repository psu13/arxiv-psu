\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced a novel compilation scheme called ``\emph{GPU First}'' that enables automatic compilation of legacy CPU applications directly for GPUs without requiring any modification to the application source.
Our approach simplifies the task of identifying code regions that can benefit from acceleration and facilitates rapid testing of code modifications on real GPU hardware, thereby making GPUs easily accessible to non-experts.
We evaluated our approach on two proxy applications, four micro benchmarks, and three SPEC OMP 2012 codes with CPU parallelism to demonstrate the simplicity of porting host applications to the GPU.
Our approach closely matched the performance of corresponding manually offloaded kernels, with up to $14.36\times$ speedup on the GPU.
Our evaluation further validates that the \emph{GPU First} methodology can effectively guide porting efforts and identify parallel regions that require reorganization to achieve good scaling behavior on the GPU.
Overall, our proposed approach offers a simple and efficient solution for porting legacy CPU applications to GPUs, enabling non-experts to access GPUs, and facilitating faster development and porting times which will lead to more efficient use of resources.
