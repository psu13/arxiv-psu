abstract = "The curious correlations between distant events in quantum phenomena suggest the existence of non-local influences. Indeed, as John Bell demonstrated in his celebrated theorem, granted some plausible premises any quantum theory will predict the existence of such non-local influences. One of the theorem's premises is that the probability distribution of states that systems may assume is independent of the measurements that they undergo at a later time. Retro-causal interpretations of quantum mechanics postulate backward influences from measurement events to the state of systems at an earlier time, and accordingly violate this premise. We argue that retro-causal interpretations predict the existence of closed causal loops, which pose challenges for the predictive and explanatory power of these interpretations."

This box, inspired from the CHSH inequality, was first proposed by Popescu and Rohrlich to examine the question: given that a maximally entangled pair of qubits is non-local, why is it not maximally non-local? We believe that understanding the power of this box will yield insight into the non-locality of quantum mechanics. It was shown recently by Cerf, Gisin, Massar and Popescu, that this imaginary device is able to simulate correlations from any measurement on a singlet state. Here, we show that the non-local box can in fact do much more: through the simulation of the magic square pseudo-telepathy game and the Mermin-GHZ pseudo-telepathy game, we show that the non-local box can simulate quantum correlations that no entangled pair of qubits can, in a bipartite scenario and even in a multi-party scenario. Finally we show that a single non-local box cannot simulate all quantum correlations and propose a generalization for a multi-party non-local box. In particular, we show quantum correlations whose simulation requires an exponential amount of non-local boxes, in the number of maximally entangled qubit pairs."

By choosing a specific model for the dissipative interaction of the system of interest with its environment, we are able to evaluate the influence functional in closed form and express it in terms of a few parameters such as the phenomenological viscosity coefficient. We show that in the limit h→0 the results obtained from the influence functional formalism reduce to the classical Fokker-Planck equation. In the case of a simple harmonic oscillator with arbitrarily strong damping and at arbitrary temperature, we obtain an explicit expression for the time evolution of the complete density matrix ϱ(x, x′, t) when the system starts in a particular kind of pure state. We compare our results with those of other approaches to the problem of dissipation in quantum mechanics."

Various approaches have been put forward in the past two decades in an attempt to single out quantum nonlocality. However, none of them can explain the set of quantum correlations arising in the simplest scenarios. Here, it is shown that generalized uncertainty relations, as well as a specific notion of locality, give rise to both familiar and new characterizations of quantum correlations. In particular, we identify a condition, relativistic independence, which states that uncertainty relations are local in the sense that they cannot be influenced by other experimenters{\textquoteright} choices of measuring instruments. We prove that theories with nonlocal correlations stronger than the quantum ones do not satisfy this notion of locality, and therefore, they either violate the underlying generalized uncertainty relations or allow experimenters to nonlocally tamper with the uncertainty relations of their peers.},

Experimental results evidently refute the theorem's predictions for these theories and favour those of quantum mechanics. The conclusions are philosophically startling: either one must totally abandon the realistic philosophy of most working scientists, or dramatically revise out concept of space-time.}

It otherwise satisfies the hypotheses of setting independence, outcome independence—made in the derivation of the Bell inequality—and that of compliance with Malus's law—made in the derivation of the Leggett inequality. It is shown that the violation of the measurement independence hypothesis may be explained alternatively by assuming a non-local influence of the detector settings on the hidden variables, or by taking the hidden variable to influence the choice of settings (limitation of free will), or finally by purporting a conspiracy. It is demonstrated that the last two cases admit a realization through existing local classical resources.}

abstract="The Block Universe idea, representing spacetime as a fixed whole, suggests the flow of time is an illusion: the entire universe just is, with no special meaning attached to the present time. This paper points out that this view, in essence represented by usual space time diagrams, is based on time- reversible microphysical laws, which fail to capture essential features of the time-irreversible macro-physical behaviour and the development of emergent complex systems, including life, which exist in the real universe. When these are taken into account, the unchanging block universe view of spacetime is best replaced by an evolving block universe which extends as time evolves, with the potential of the future continually becoming the certainty of the past; spacetime itself evolves, as do the entities within it. However, this time evolution is not related to any preferred surfaces in spacetime; rather it is associated with the evolution of proper time along families of world lines.",

abstract="A local and deterministic model of quantum correlations is always possible, as shown explicitly by Brans in 1988: one simply needs the physical systems being measured to have a suitable statistical correlation with the physical systems performing the measurement, via some common cause. Hence, to derive no-go results such as Bell inequalities, an assumption of measurement independence is crucial. It is a surprisingly strong assumption---less than 1 / 15 bits of prior correlation suffice for a local model of the singlet state of two qubits---with ramifications for the security of quantum communication protocols. Indeed, without this assumption, any statistical correlations whatsoever---even those which appear to allow explicit superluminal signalling---have a corresponding local deterministic model. It is argued that `quantum nonlocality' is bad terminology, and that measurement independence does not equate to `experimental free will'. Brans' 1988 model is extended to show that no more than {\$}{\$}2{\backslash}log d{\$}{\$}2logdbits of prior correlation are required for a local deterministic model of the correlations between any two d-dimensional quantum systems.",

Maudlin considered this objection fatal. However, the TI did not die; rather, a number of responses were developed, some attempting to accommodate Maudlin's example within the existing TI, and others modifying the TI. I argue that none of these responses is fully adequate. The reason, I submit, is that there are two aspects to Maudlin's objection; the more readily soluble aspect has received all the attention, but the more problematic aspect has gone unnoticed. I consider the prospects for developing a successful retrocausal quantum theory in light of this second aspect of the objection."

In a delayed-choice experiment, one decides which of one or another complementary feature of a phenomenon the observing device will register after the development of the phenomenon is already under way. Several proposals for such experiments are reviewed. When a delayed-choice experiment is conducted at the cosmological level (light coming to the telescope from a distant quasar by two different gravitationally-bent routes), "one-half of the ghost of a photon" can be delayed by a month or a year compared to the "other half". The circumstance raises an interesting technical question, "How can one keep one-half the ghost of a photon alive for a year?" Bohr's phenomenon is discussed as a primordial building element for all of physics. }
