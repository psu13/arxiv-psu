\begin{document}

Here is a Penrose (or Carter-Penrose diagram, or Conformal diagram) for empty space.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=4]
        
    % BOUNDING DIAGRAM
    \coordinate (O) at ( 0, 0); % center: origin (r,t) = (0,0)
    \coordinate (S) at ( 0,-1); % south: t=-infty, i-
    \coordinate (N) at ( 0, 1); % north: t=+infty, i+
    \coordinate (E) at ( 1, 0); % east:  r=+infty, i0
    \coordinate (NE) at ( .5, .5); 
    \coordinate (SE) at ( .5, -.5);
    \coordinate (SI) at (.6,.7);
    \draw[thick] (NE) -- (E);
    \draw[thick] (SE) -- (E);
    \draw[dashed] (SE) -- (NE);

    % LABELS
    \node[right] at (E) {$i^0$};
    \node[above] at (NE) {$i^+$};
    \node[below] at (SE) {$i^-$};
    \node[above right] at (0.75,0.25) {$\scri^+$};
    \node[below ] at (0.75,-0.3) {$\scri^-$};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

What this picture does is collapse all of space into the $x$-axis and time into the $y$-axis.
The idea is then that you can summarize all of the possible causal relationships in
all of infinite space and all of time in one small finite picture. Objects moving at the speed
of light then move along lines that have a slope of exactly 45 degrees
($\pi/4$). These are also called ``null'' rays or trajectories in the literature.

For convenience we stretched the diagram in the $x$ direction a bit so we have a bit more room for labels
and such. 


Here are what the labels mean:

\begin{itemize}
\item $i^+$ is where time is at $+$ infinity, also called ``timelike'' infinity.
\item $i^-$ is where time is at $-$ infinity.
\item $i^0$ is $+$ infinity for space, , also called ``spacelike'' infinity. The zero here is because
time is zero on this line?
\item $\scri^+$ is the boundary of the universe in the future at plus infinity.
\item $\scri^-$ is the boundary of the universe in the past at minus infinity.
\end{itemize}

Now here is a more complicated diagram of a star collapsing to become a black hole. This diagram is not
square anymore because I wanted more room for the extra labels and things. So it's a bit wider than it is
tall for convenience. That's why $i^0$ seems like it's in the wrong place.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=4]
        
    % BOUNDING DIAGRAM

    \node[below, rotate=-45] at (1,.5) {\small $v = \infty$};
    
    % singularity
  	\draw[thick, decorate,decoration={zigzag,aspect=0,amplitude=2.3pt,segment length=3.5pt}] (0,0.75) -- (NE);

    \node[anchor=south] at (SI) {\footnotesize Singularity};

    \draw[-latex]  (C.north) -- (0.11, -.5);
    \draw[-latex]  (SI)  -- (0.3, .78);

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Here are what the new labels mean:

\begin{itemize}
\item $r=0$ is the origin of a polar coordinate system if we wanted to use one. Along this line the
radius of the start is $0$.
\item ${\mathcal H}^+$ is position of the event horizon at plus infinity.
\item The wavy line is the the singularity inside the black hole.
\item The blue line is the star collapsing and forming the black hole.
\item The coordinate system $(u,v)$ defines

 $u$ move ``inward'' with respect to the eventual black hole from past
infinity towards the event horizon. The line at $u=+\infty$ is the where the event horizon forms.
\item The coordinates $v$ go from $-\infty$
\item The ray at constant $v_0$
\end{itemize}
