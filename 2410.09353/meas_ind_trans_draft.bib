abstract={The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2--7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times---our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8--14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

abstract = {Information spreading in interacting quantum systems is of relevance to a wide range of settings, from black holes to strange metals. Mi et al. used the Sycamore quantum processor to study this process. Through judicial design of quantum circuits, the researchers were able to separate the contributions of operator spreading and operator entanglement. Measuring the mean value and fluctuations of a specific correlator enabled quantifying these distinct contributions. —JS Operator spreading and entanglement were studied in a 53-qubit quantum processor. Interactions in quantum systems can spread initially localized quantum information into the exponentially many degrees of freedom of the entire system. Understanding this process, known as quantum scrambling, is key to resolving several open questions in physics. Here, by measuring the time-dependent evolution and fluctuation of out-of-time-order correlators, we experimentally investigate the dynamics of quantum scrambling on a 53-qubit quantum processor. We engineer quantum circuits that distinguish operator spreading and operator entanglement and experimentally observe their respective signatures. We show that whereas operator spreading is captured by an efficient classical model, operator entanglement in idealized circuits requires exponentially scaled computational resources to simulate. These results open the path to studying complex and practically relevant physical observables with near-term quantum processors.}}

year={2023},

volume={14},
number={1},
pages={2918},
abstract={Open quantum systems have been shown to host a plethora of exotic dynamical phases. Measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum systems are a striking example of this phenomena. However, naive realizations of such phase transitions requires an exponential number of repetitions of the experiment which is practically unfeasible on large systems. Recently, it has been proposed that these phase transitions can be probed locally via entangling reference qubits and studying their purification dynamics. In this work, we leverage modern machine learning tools to devise a neural network decoder to determine the state of the reference qubits conditioned on the measurement outcomes. We show that the entanglement phase transition manifests itself as a stark change in the learnability of the decoder function. We study the complexity and scalability of this approach in both Clifford and Haar random circuits and discuss how it can be utilized to detect entanglement phase transitions in generic experiments.},

title={Measurement-induced entanglement and teleportation on a noisy quantum processor},
journal={Nature},
year={2023},
month={Oct},
day={01},
volume={622},
number={7983},
pages={481-486},
abstract={Measurement has a special role in quantum theory1: by collapsing the wavefunction, it can enable phenomena such as teleportation2 and thereby alter the `arrow of time' that constrains unitary evolution. When integrated in many-body dynamics, measurements can lead to emergent patterns of quantum information in space--time3--10 that go beyond the established paradigms for characterizing phases, either in or out of equilibrium11--13. For present-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors14, the experimental realization of such physics can be problematic because of hardware limitations and the stochastic nature of quantum measurement. Here we address these experimental challenges and study measurement-induced quantum information phases on up to 70 superconducting qubits. By leveraging the interchangeability of space and time, we use a duality mapping9,15--17 to avoid mid-circuit measurement and access different manifestations of the underlying phases, from entanglement scaling3,4 to measurement-induced teleportation18. We obtain finite-sized signatures of a phase transition with a decoding protocol that correlates the experimental measurement with classical simulation data. The phases display remarkably different sensitivity to noise, and we use this disparity to turn an inherent hardware limitation into a useful diagnostic. Our work demonstrates an approach to realizing measurement-induced physics at scales that are at the limits of current NISQ processors.},
