	abstract = {It is shown that an ideal measurement of a one-particle wave packet state of a relativistic quantum field in Minkowski spacetime enables superluminal signalling. The result holds for a measurement that takes place over an intervention region in spacetime whose extent in time in some frame is longer than the light-crossing time of the packet in that frame. Moreover, these results are shown to apply not only to ideal measurements but also to unitary transformations that rotate two orthogonal one-particle states into each other. In light of these observations, possible restrictions on the allowed types of intervention are considered. A more physical approach to such questions is to construct explicit models of the interventions as interactions between the field and other quantum systems such as detectors. The prototypical Unruh–DeWitt detector couples to the field operator itself and so most likely respects relativistic causality. On the other hand, detector models which couple to a finite set of frequencies of field modes are shown to lead to superluminal signalling. Such detectors do, however, provide successful phenomenological models of atom–qubits interacting with quantum fields in a cavity but are valid only on time scales many orders of magnitude larger than the light-crossing time of the cavity.}

Data obtained by atomic force microscopy combined with a simple model for surface scattering suggest that Q can be limited by residual surface inhomogeneities. Absorption by absorbed water can also explain why the material limit is not reached at longer wavelengths in the near infrared.},

abstract = {The importance of the Unruh effect lies in the fact that, together with the related (but distinct) Hawking effect, it serves to link the three main branches of modern physics: thermal/statistical physics, relativity theory/gravitation, and quantum physics. However, different researchers can have in mind different phenomena when they speak of “the Unruh effect” in flat spacetime and its generalization to curved spacetimes. Three different approaches are reviewed here. They are shown to yield results that are sometimes concordant and sometimes discordant. The discordance is disconcerting only if one insists on taking literally the definite article in “the Unruh effect.” It is argued that the role of linking different branches of physics is better served by taking “the Unruh effect” to designate a family of related phenomena. The relation between the Hawking effect and the generalized Unruh effect for curved spacetimes is briefly discussed.}

	journal = {J. Phys. A},
	abstract = {It has been demonstrated that, in 1+1'a0spacetime dimensions, massless fields can be used for information transmission even between parties that are time-like rather than light-like separated'97and even without the receiver obtaining any energy from the sender. Here, it is shown that this phenomenon is not limited to a particular model of signaling device, but is based on general properties of the quantum field: energy propagates strictly only on the lightcone, whereas perturbations to the field amplitude, which can carry information, also'a0permeate'a0the inside of the future lightcone of the sender. It is also shown that this time-like and energyless signaling in massless fields occurs in Dirichlet cavities, which shows that the phenomenon is not confined to setups with a zero mode. Moreover, it is shown that the phenomenon extends beyond perturbation theory, namely by deriving the phenomenon non-perturbatively for the case where the sender and receiver systems are modeled as harmonic oscillators. To illustrate the propagation of energy in massless fields, the energy density that results from temporarily coupling an Unruh'96DeWitt detector at rest to the vacuum of the field is calculated.}

To this end, we identify the detector states which achieve maximal signal strength. We use these results to investigate the impact of relativistic effects on signaling between detectors in inertial and uniformly accelerated motion which communicate via a massless field in Minkowski spacetime.}

Using this classification, we discuss the consequences of imposing complete positivity on Gaussian dynamics. In particular, we show that non-symplectic operations must be active to allow for complete positivity. In addition, non-symplectic operations can, in fact, conserve the volume of phase space only if the restriction of complete positivity is lifted. We then discuss the implications for the relationship between information and energy flows in open quantum mechanics.}

We discuss recent theoretical results reporting on the production of entanglement in quantum fields due to the expansion of the underlying spacetime. We explore how these results are affected by the statistics of the field (bosonic or fermionic), the type of expansion (de Sitter or asymptotically stationary), and the coupling to spacetime curvature (conformal or minimal). We then consider the extraction of entanglement from a quantum field by coupling to local detectors and how this procedure can be used to distinguish curvature from heating by their entanglement signature. We review the role played by quantum fluctuations in the early universe in nucleating the formation of galaxies and other cosmic structures through their conversion into classical density anisotropies during and after inflation. We report on current literature attempting to account for this transition in a rigorous way and discuss the importance of entanglement and decoherence in this process. We conclude with some prospects for further theoretical and experimental research in this area. These include extensions of current theoretical efforts, possible future observational pursuits, and experimental analogues that emulate these cosmic effects in a laboratory setting.}

@article{Olson2012,
	Abstract = {An intriguing property of the massless quantum vacuum state is that
	it contains entanglement between both spacelike and timelike separated
	regions of space-time. The implications of timelike entanglement
	and its connection to standard entanglement, however, are unexplored.
	Here we show that timelike entanglement can be extracted from the
	massless Minkowski vacuum and converted into standard entanglement
	"at a given time" between two inertial, two-state detectors at the
	same spatial location: one coupled to the field in the past and the
	other coupled to the field in the future. The procedure used here
	demonstrates a time correlation as a requirement for extraction;
	e.g., if the past detector was active at a quarter to 12:00, then
	the future detector must wait to become active at precisely a quarter
	past 12:00 in order to achieve entanglement.},

	Abstract = {We propose a quantum mechanical method of detecting weak vibrational disturbances inspired by the protocol of entanglement farming. We consider a setup where pairs of atoms in their ground state are successively sent through an optical cavity. It is known that in this way it is possible to drive that cavity toward a stable fixed-point state. Here we study how that fixed-point state depends on the time interval between pairs of atoms and on the distance between the cavityʼs mirrors. Taking advantage of an extremely precise resonance effect, we find that there are special values of these parameters where the fixed-point state is highly sensitive to perturbations, even harmonic vibrations with frequencies several orders of magnitude below the cavityʼs natural frequency. We propose that this sensitivity may be useful for high precision metrology.},

However, in the context of quantum communication, this phenomenon must be reconciled carefully with the no-cloning principle. In this context, we here study how wireless communication of quantum information can be realized via relativistic fields. To this end, we extend existing frameworks to allow for a non-perturbative description of, e.g. quantum state transfer. We consider, in particular, the case of 1+1 spacetime dimensions, which already allows for a number of interesting scenarios, pointing to, for example, new methods for tasks similar to quantum secret sharing.}

We extend a recently proposed regularization of the massless scalar field Wightman function in four-dimensional Minkowski space to arbitrary dimension, to the massive scalar field, to quotients of Minkowski space under discrete isometry groups and to the massless Dirac field. We investigate in detail the transition rate of inertial and uniformly accelerated detectors on the quotient spaces under groups generated by (t,x,y,z)↦(t,x,y,z+2a), (t,x,y,z)↦(t,−x,y,z), (t,x,y,z)↦(t,−x,−y,z), (t,x,y,z)↦(t,−x,−y,z+a) and some higher dimensional generalizations. For motions in at constant y and z on the latter three spaces the response is time dependent. We also discuss the response of static detectors on the RP3 geon and inertial detectors on RP3 de Sitter space via their associated global embedding Minkowski spaces (GEMS). The response on RP3 de Sitter space, found both directly and in its GEMS, provides support for the validity of applying the GEMS procedure to detector responses and to quotient spaces such as RP3 de Sitter space and the RP3 geon where the embedding spaces are Minkowski spaces with suitable identifications."

	abstract = {The transition probability in the first-order perturbation theory for an Unruh–DeWitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field in Minkowski space is calculated. It has been shown recently that the conventional iϵ regularization prescription for the correlation function leads to non-Lorentz invariant results for the transition rate, and a different regularization, involving spatial smearing of the field, has been advocated to replace it. We show that the non-Lorentz invariance arises solely from the assumption of sudden switch-on and switch-off of the detector, and that when the model includes a smooth switching function the results from the conventional regularization are both finite and Lorentz invariant. The sharp switching limit of the model is also discussed, as well as the fall-off properties of the spectrum for large frequencies.}

It is shown that maximal correlations always exist between suitably chosen local projection operators associated with spacelike separated regions of space-time, however far apart these regions may be. The connection of this result with the well-known Fregenhagen bound showing exponential decay of correlations with distance is explained, and the relevance of the discussion to the question ``What do particle detectors detect?'' is addressed.",

	abstract = {It is shown that an ideal measurement of a one-particle wave packet state of a relativistic quantum field in Minkowski spacetime enables superluminal signalling. The result holds for a measurement that takes place over an intervention region in spacetime whose extent in time in some frame is longer than the light-crossing time of the packet in that frame. Moreover, these results are shown to apply not only to ideal measurements but also to unitary transformations that rotate two orthogonal one-particle states into each other. In light of these observations, possible restrictions on the allowed types of intervention are considered. A more physical approach to such questions is to construct explicit models of the interventions as interactions between the field and other quantum systems such as detectors. The prototypical Unruh–DeWitt detector couples to the field operator itself and so most likely respects relativistic causality. On the other hand, detector models which couple to a finite set of frequencies of field modes are shown to lead to superluminal signalling. Such detectors do, however, provide successful phenomenological models of atom–qubits interacting with quantum fields in a cavity but are valid only on time scales many orders of magnitude larger than the light-crossing time of the cavity.}
