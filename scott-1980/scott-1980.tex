\noindent
Mathematical theories arise for many different reasons, sometimes in connection with specific applications and often owing to accidental inspiration. From time to time we ought to ask ourselves concerning our theories where should they have come from; usually the answer will have little to do with the exact historical development. The $\l$-calculus is, I feel, a case in point. In Scott (1980), in the Kleene Festschrift, I made up a story of where the theory of type-free $\l$-calculus could have come from. Any number of people who heard my lec­ture and read the manuscript were cross with me. They said ``But it didn't develop that way! And besides we doubt it ever would have.'' But this reaction misses the point of my story. I shall not, however repeat the earlier story here, for the point of the present paper is different. For those people who do not like to discuss philosophy --- even Philosophy of Mathematics --- my remarks here can be taken as a suggestion of how to group diverse models of $\l$-calculus rather uniformly under a general scheme. The scheme is by now rather well known and not at all original with me. What I hope can be regarded as a useful con­tribution is my putting of the ideas in a certain order. As I consider the order to be a natural one, I feel there is a philosophical significance to my activity; but I should not want to force this view on anyone.

\section{Theories of Functions}


Everyone agrees that $\l$-calculus is a theory of functions.
But we must ask: ``What kind of a theory?'' And also: ``Have we got the best theory?'' Personally, I think we should also in­quire: ``How does it relate to other theories?'' I certainly find many discussions far too silent on this last issue. Well, what other theories are there? Certainly set theory comes to mind at once, and no set theory would be worth its salt if it did not provide a theory of functions. Let us not try to catalogue the various known theories here but look at a theory in the style of Zermelo --- and we do not have even to be too specific, since in any case such a theory is very standard. What is ``unsatisfactory'' about Zermelo's theory is the limiti­zation-of-size view of sets: any {\it one} set $A$ is extremely small compared to the size of $\V$, the class or universe of {\it all} sets. Thus, functions $f : A \to B$ mapping one set $A$ into another set $B$ tell us very little about operations on all sets, maps on $\V$ into $\V$. We therefore have an urge to ``improve'' our set theory by constructing a class theory. Sets are elements $A \in \V$; while classes are sub-collections $B \subseteq \V$. As $\V$ is (by the usual assump­tions) so highly closed under so many operations, we have no difficulty in construing certain classes as maps $F: \V \to \V$. For example for all $X \in \V$ we could have $F(X) = \{X\}$ or $F(X) = A \times X$ (where $A$ is a fixed set).

The passage from sets to classes is a familiar and useful move in the formalization of the theory: many things can be done generally for classes and then specialized to sets. And having a notation for functions defined on all sets is in many cases a great advantage. But wait. What about operations on classes? What should we say about them? Given any two classes $A$ and $B$, we can form their union, $A \union  B$. The operation, $\union\!: \V \times \V \to \V$, of union of {\it sets} does not directly apply to {\it classes} even though there is a connection. Do we also want a theory of class operations? Do we have to go to hyperclasses (classes of classes)? Is there any end to this expansion?


[{\it An Aside}: The story of Scott (1980) was meant to suggest one answer --- the one known to Plotkin (1972). Namely, we con­sider only ``continuous'' class operations. These are objects $F$ such that $F(X)$ is defined for every class $X \subseteq \V$ and $F(X)$ is a class, too. Moreover $F$ should satisfy:

\begin{enumerate}

\item $X \inc Y$ always implies $F(X)\inc F(Y)$

\item Whenever $A \inc F(X)$ and $A$ is a set, then $A\inc F(B)$ for some set $B \inc X$.

\end{enumerate}
%
We do not have time to discuss the justification of the word "continuous" here; suffice it to say that conditions (1) and (2) are not as strict as they at first might seem. Every ordinary map $f : \V \to \V$ determines a continuous class operator by the def­inition:

$$
F(X) = \{f(x) \mid x \in X\}.
$$
%
Furthermore, $F$ determines $f$, for we have: $y = f(x)$ if and only if $\{y\} = F(\{x\})$,
for all $x,y \in \V$. In a suitable sense, then, nothing has been lost; but what has been gained?
The reply is that continuous class operators can be identi­fied with classes. We could write, for instance:

$$ F = \{(A,B) \mid A,B \in \V {\textrm { and }} A \inc F(B) \},$$
where, say:

$$
(A,B) = \{\{A\}, \{A,B\}\},
$$
More in harmony with Scott (1980) would be: $F = \{(a,B) \mid  a,B \in \V {\textrm { and } } a \in F(B)\}$.

Either trick reduces operator theory to class theory - in the continuous case. And the same trick could be carried over to other kinds of set theory (e.g. Quine's). What we know is that operator theory gives a model for $\l$-calculus; it is a quite elementary model, too. Nice as this connection is, it is not the topic of the pre­ sent paper: we do not want to make $\l$-calculus depend on set theory, since then we have still to explain where set theory comes from. But the connection should be borne in mind.]

Perhaps set theory brings in too many extraneous issues. $\V$, after all, is a massive object closed under all manner of strange operations. What we are probably seeking is a ``purer'' view of functions: a theory of functions in themselves, not a theory of functions derived from sets. What, then, is a pure theory of functions? Answer: category theory. General category theory is a very pure theory: it is the milk-and-water theory of functions under composition. This composition operation is associative and possesses neutral ele­ments (compositions of zero terms). That is about all you can say about it except to stress that it is also a rather bland theory of types. Every function $f$ has a (unique) domain and codomain, and we write:

$$f: \dom f \to \cod f$$
%
Every possible domain is a codomain (and conversely), because if $A$ is such, then

$$\dom \id_A = A = \cod \id_A$$
%
where $\id_A$ is the neutral element of type $A$ (If we want to be especially parsimonious in entities, we can even write $\id_A = A$, because each of $\id_A$ and $A$ uniquely deter­mines the other.). 

The point of distinguishing domains and codomains is that not only do they specify the type of $f$, but a composition $g \comp f$ is
defined if, and only if, $\dom g = \cod f$. And then $\dom(g \comp f) = \dom f$ and $\cod (g \comp f) = \cod (g)$. We usually write this as a ``rule of inference'':

$$
\inferrule
  {{f: A \to B} \\ {g: B \to C}}
  {g \comp f: A \to C}
$$
with the understanding that the typing of $f \comp  g$ can only be ob­tained by such an application of the rule. The types, then, are invoked just to type functions, and the only theory involv­ed is that of the ``transition'' of types under composition. 

Sets (and set-theoretical mappings) do of course form a cat­egory; category theory is meant to be more general than set theory. We should construe the function entities here as tri­ples of sets $(A,f,B)$ where
$$
f \inc A \times B {\textrm{ and }}\, \forall x \in A \,\, \exists! y \in B\,\, s.t. \,\, (x,y) \in f.
$$
%
The definition of composition is obvious. Sets, in this way, give us only one special example of a category.
I beg forgiveness of the reader for boring him. All of this is well known to the moderately awake undergraduate in mathe­matics. Indeed, that is the point: there is plenty of evi­dence now that category theory is a natural and useful theory of functions. I do not have to rehearse the examples as they can be found in any number of books (e.g. Mac Lane (1971]).
There is a rather important logical point to stress, however
important for anyone who has thought about $\l$-calculus models. Category theory is very extensional. We assume as axioms the equations:
%
$$\id_A \comp f = f \comp \id_B =  f$$
%
and 
$$h\comp (g \comp f) = (h \comp g) \comp f,$$
%
provided $A= \dom f$ and $B = \cod f$ and the double compositions are defined. These are {\it functional} equations, and they say that two functions defined in different ways are in fact {\it identical}.
Furthermore, identical things can everywhere replace one another.

This point about extensionality may not seem exciting or im­portant, but the logician should remember that, in certain intensional theories of functions, ``obvious'' definitions will not provide categories. We shall return to this point later. But is category theory the long-sought answer? No, no, not at all. Category theory {\it pure} provides nothing explicitly aside from identity functions --- and they occur only if we have some possible domain. We do get compositions if we have the neces­sary terms. Thus, as it stands, category theory has no existential import. (It was not meant to.) Set theory has "too much" existential import. (It was meant to.) What we seek is the middle way --- and an argument that the middle way is natural and general.

There is no need to build up unnecessary suspense: the middle way is the theory of the (so called) cartesian closed categories.
Fortunately Lambek has written extensively about the theory, and I can refer the reader to his papers for fur­ther details; I also am happy to acknowledge his writings as helping me understand what is going on. If we remark that his paper in this volume is called "From $\l$-calculus to cartesian closed categories'', then we might say that my present paper ought to be called ``From cartesian closed categories to $\l$-calculus.'' 
I am trying to find out where $\l$-calculus should come from, and the fact that the notion of a cartesian closed category (\ccc) is a late developing one (Eilenberg \& Kelly (1966)), is not relevant to the argument: I shall try to explain in my own words in the next section why we should look to it {\it first}.

\section{A Theory of Types}

I say "a theory", because there are many possible theories; indeed pure category theory is one of the theories. 
Its weak­ness lies in the fact that we are given no construction principles, no way of making new types from old. From the point of view of logic what should we expect? What more do we want to say beyond relations between types which hold when a mapping statement $f : A\to	B$ obtains.

An immediate question that must come to anyone's mind con­cerns the {\it arity} of functions. The usual way of reading a map­ping statement is to take it as a statement about {\it one-place} functions, and the $\circ$ of composition is the composition of one­ place functions. This seems very restricted.

People have suggested generalizing categories to multi-place functions with concomitant compositions (e.g. the book Szabo (1978)), but it does not seem the neatest solution. Much easier is to assume that the category has cartesian products - and more specifically particular representatives of the product
domains are chosen. As a special case we will know what the cartesian power $A^n$ is for each $n=0,1,2,\cdots$, and $n$-ary functions
are then maps $f: A^n\to B$. Not much of a surprise.

We have to take care, however. In the first place, a given category may not have cartesian products (it fails to have enough types). Even if it does, the maps allowed may be too restricted - for logical purposes. Take the category of groups and homomorphisms, for example. The required products exist.
A map $f : A^2 \to B$ in this category has to be a group homomor­phism, naturally. Suppose two maps $u,v: A \to B$ were given.
Intuitively we think in terms of elements and that we are map­ping $x \mapsto u(x)$ and $y \mapsto v(y)$. The pointwise group product of the maps, namely, $x,y \mapsto  u(x) \cdot v(y)$ is a very nice map $g : A^2 \to B$ in the ordinary sense --- but unless the group $B$ is abelian, $g$ is not a homomorphism. It is a ``logical'' map but not an ``algebra­ic'' map. Pure category theory applies to many algebraic situa­tions (as everyone knows that is why it is a good theory), but not all categories are ``logical'' even if they have products. In the example of groups, what was "missing" was the group 
multiplication $\mu: B^2 \to B$ as a map in the category. (Inverse is missing as well, since it reverses order.) There is an in­teresting theory of algebraic theories that address the ques­tion of the proper categorial construction of categories of al­gebras, but I do not think we should invoke that theory here.

The precise description of products is as follows. We as­sume our category has a special domain $\bbone$ (the empty product, so $A^0 = B^0 = {\bbone}$), and for each domain $A$ a special map $\zeromap_A: A \mapsto \bbone$. (The domain $\bbone$, intuitively, has just one ``element''.)  Moreover the rule about maps is that $\zeromap_A$ is unique; that is whenever $f : A \mapsto \bbone$, then we have the equation 
$$f = \zeromap_A .$$
%
Concerning binary products, we have for any two domains $A$ and $B$ a special choice of a domain $A \times B$ (and so $A^{n+1} = A^n \times A$), and special maps
\begin{align*}
p_{AB}&: A \times B \to A\\
q_{AB}&: A \times B \to B
\end{align*}
%
But the mere existence of ``projections'' does not characterize $A \times B$ as a product. We have to assume that there is a chosen pairing operation $\langle f,g \rangle$ on maps such that types are assigned by the rule:
%
$$
\inferrule
  {{f: C \to A} \\ {g: C \to B}}
  {\langle f,g \rangle: C \to A \times B}
$$
%
Moreover, provided $f$ and $g$ are as above and $h: C \to A \times B $ we have to assume
\begin{align*}
p_{AB} \comp \langle f,g \rangle &= f\\
q_{AB} \comp \langle f,g \rangle &= g\\
\langle p_{AB}\comp h, q_{AB}\comp h\rangle &= h
\end{align*}
%
that is to say, there is an explicit one-one correspondence between the pairs of maps $f$, $g$ and the map $h$ into the product. This all now makes $A times B$ well behaved within the category. 

So much for a theory of tuples and multiary maps. But we still want a theory of functions: a category allows us to talk of selected functions, while we would want various equations to have a force relating to arbitrary functions. The answer to this desire is function spaces as explicit domains in the cate­ gory. Given $A$ and $B$ we want to form $(A \to B)$ as a domain in its own right; if so, there are many maps that have to be set down to make the function space behave. (And here we must defi­nitely leave the category of groups.)

In the first place there has to be an evaluation map
$\ebc : (B \to C) \times B \to C$ with the intuitive interpretation that it is the map $ f,x \mapsto f(x)$. In the second place there has to be a map for shifting around variables; more precisely, suppose
$h: A\times B \to C$ is a map with two arguments. In an evaluation $h(x,y)$, we can think of holding $x$ constant and regarding $h(x,y)$ as a function of $y$. We need a name for this function --- and for the correspondence with possible values of x. We write
$$
\L_{ABC}\, h : A\times B -> C
$$
%
so that the function we were thinking of --- given $x$ --- was
$(\L_{ABC} h)\, (x)$. But all this function-value notation is not cate­gorical notation; what we have to say is that there is a one­ one correspondence via $\L$ between maps $h : A\times B \to C$ and maps $k: A \to (B \to C)$. This comes down to these two equations:
%
\begin{align*}
\ep \comp \langle (\L h)\comp p, q\rangle &= h, {\textrm{ and}} \\
\L(\ep \comp \langle k \comp p, q \rangle) &= k.
\end{align*}
%
(It is necessary to have subscripts here: $\L_{ABC}$, $p_{AB}$, $q_{AB}$, and $\ebc$; but we leave them off when there is no ambiguity.)

The notation is now wholly categorical (and mostly unread­able). Category theorists put the whole thing (that is, the definition of a \ccc, which is what we have just given) into the language of functors, which has a lot of sense. But if you have never seen any abstract category theory before, it is really rather too abstract. The idea of a \ccc\ as a system of types is, I think, reasonably simple. Each \ccc repre­sents a theory of functions. The maps in the category are cer­tain special functions that are used to express the relations between the types (the domains of the category). In order to
be able to deal with multiary functions, we assume we can form
(and analyze) products. In order to be able to work with trans­formations of arbitrary functions (``arbitrary'' within the the­ory), we assume we can form function spaces: this is where ``higher'' types enter the theory, as in the sequence of domains:
$$
A, (A \to A), ((A \to A) \to A), (((A \to A) \to A) \to A), \cdots
$$
To be able really to view these domains as function spaces, cer­tain operations, $\ep$ and $\L$, with characteristic equations have to be laid down.
If a \ccc\ is a theory of functions (and we include here higher-type functions), then the theory of \ccc's is the the­ory of types of the title of this section. It is only one such theory. ``Bigger'' theories could be obtained by demanding more types: for example we could axiomatize {\it coproduct}s (disjoint sums), $\bbzero$ and $A+ B$. We could demand infinite products and co­ products. We could throw in a type $\Omega$ of ``propositions'' so that higher types like $(A^n \to \Omega)$ correspond to $n$-ary predicates. This gets into topos theory (as in Johnstone (1977) or Goldblatt (1979) --- just to name two recent texts). But the bigger the theory, the more involved, and full definitions at this point would not help this discussion very much.
We could also look for ``smaller'' theories. Some examples --- of a rather highly formal nature --- can be found in Szabo (1978) with an indication of the algebraic interest of these other type theories. However, a \ccc\ is rather more ``logical'' and good as a middle ground; further Lambek has explained the logical interest; there is a perfect correspondence between \ccc's and (extensional) typed $\l$-calculi. The reader can turn to Lam­bek's paper for details and references.

\def\means#1{\llbracket\, #1 \,\rrbracket}

Roughly put, when we formally define the typed A-language (with types in the given \ccc), then if $\tau$ is a typed $\l$-expression with free variables of types $A^0, A^1,\cdots, A^{n-1}$ we can de­ fine the ``meaning'' of $\tau$ as a map
%
$$
\means{\tau}: A_0 \times A_1 \times \dots A_{n-1} \to B
$$
%
where $B$ is the type of $\tau$. For example if $u$ is a variable of type $(B \to C)$ and $v$ a variable of type $B$, then
$$
\means{u(v)}: (B \to C) \times B \to C,
$$
%
and in fact $\means{u(v)} = \ebc$. Also if $x$ is the variable in $\tau$ of type $A_{n-1}$ then
$$
\means{\lm{x}.\, \tau}: A_0 \times A_1 \times \dots A_{n-2} \to (A_{n-1} \to B),
$$
%
and in fact $\means{\l x.\, \tau} = \L\means{\tau}$. (Warning: for other of the vari­ables that are not the last mentioned, it is not so easy to write down the answer: some permutations of the products have to be introduced.)

The two characteristic equations for $\ep$ and $\L$ in the axioms for a \ccc, have very familiar translations:
\begin{align*}
( \lm{y}. h(x,y))(y') &= h(x,y') \quad and \\
\lm{y}. k(x)(y) &= k(x),
\end{align*}
%
where the type of $x$ is $A$, the type of $y$ and of $y'$ is $B$. (That is to say, the $\means{\cdot}$-meaning of the two sides of the equation is
the same map in the category.) Of course this all has to be defined more rigorously, but I hope I have conveyed the main part of the idea of Lambek's correspondence. A typed $\l$-calculus (with pairs, products, and function spaces) is just another notation for a {c.c.c}.

No, we have to be more specitic than that. Take a \ccc\ How does it correspond to a theory (of functions)? The domains
of the category are the types of the theory, and they are struc­tured by the $\bbone$, $(A \times B)$, $(A\to B)$ operations on types. Things like $\comp$,
$0$, $p$, $q$, $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$, $\ep$, and $\L$ stand for logical constants (or op­erators) --- with type subscripts as needed. Maps $f : A\to B$ of the category stand for the non-logical constants of the theory.
The equations $f = g$ between maps are the assertions of the the­ory. The logical axioms are those special equations common to all \ccc's --- the other equations are those that just happen to work out in the category. From this point of view the the­ory has no free variables: all assertions are written with constant terms. Equations with free variables can be construed as functional equations (by a heavy use of $\L$).

Conversely, a more conventional typed $\l$-calculus is an equa­tional theory with both the familiar logical axioms as well as with non-logical axioms as desired. The equations can involve free variables. Aside from the usual deduction rules for equa­lity, we must employ the extensionality rule
$$
\inferrule
  {\tau = \sigma}
  {\l x .\, \tau = \l x .\, \sigma}
$$
%
A category is formed from the types (which are {\it given} as closed under $\bbone$, $(A \times B)$, $(A \to B)$). The terms all have unambiguous
types, and they are divided into equivalence classes by the theory. As the maps of the category we take the equivalence classes $\br{\lm{x}.\tau}$ where the term $\tau$ of type $B$ has at most the variable $x$ of type $A$ free, and we write $\br{\lm{x}.\tau} : A \to B$. Of course
\begin{align*}
\id_A &= \br{\lm{x}.x}, \, \textrm{and}\\
\br{\lm{y}.\sigma} \comp \br{\lm{x}.\tau} &= \br{\lm{x}.\sigma(\tau/y)}
\end{align*}
where $\tau$ is substituted for $y$ in $\sigma$. We must verify that a cate­gory is obtained --- using the laws of $\l$-calculus.  And we must
see that if we go back again to a $\l$-calculus from the category we have essentially the same theory.

A \ccc\ (or typed $\l$-calculus - with non-logical axioms) is a satisfactory (extensional) theory of functions because all we have built into the theory is the idea of the product and the function space. The axioms set down are just those needed to make this structuring explicit.
The reason that category theory is a convenient way to for­malize this definition is that starting from the especially el­ementary concept of maps under composition, we can see that we have done nothing more than close up under products and func­tion spaces. $\l$-calculus, then, becomes mostly a notational de­ vice for setting down our functional equations. At least for typed $\l$-calculus, we can see in this way that it is harmless.

The typed $\l$-calculus is even more harmless than these last remarks suggested. By the well-known Yoneda embedding, one can prove that an arbitrary (small) category has a full and faith­ful embedding into a \ccc\ This means that starting with a given category and its maps, there is a precise sense in which it is consistent to close up under products and function spaces. No new maps are added co the given category; no new equations between the given maps are imposed by the adjunction of higher types. One can say even more than this about rela­ tive consistency, but the remark is best deferred to Section 4, where references to the proof are provided.

A final remark must be added to this section to clear up a possible confusion between theories and models.
Up to this point we have been talking about theories. In many systems of logic models can be described by theories: every model has a ``diagram'' involving constants for all the "elements" of the model and taking as axioms all statements in the language ``true'' about the model. It depends on the na,ture of the logic how hard it is to show that every ``consistent'' theory has a model.

In the case of a \ccc, a domain $A$ could be said to have an ``element'' $a$ if there is a map $a: \bbone \to A$. The question is: {\it are there enough elements}? Suppose $f,g: A\to B$ are two maps. If $a : \bbone \to A$, then $f \comp a: \bbone \to B$; so in a certain sense maps in the category behave as functions on elements. (This is not an original suggestion but is one well known in category theory.) It is natural to ask whether, if  $f \comp a	= g\comp a$ for all $a : \bbone \to A$, then $f = g$. If this is true in a \ccc, then it is said to have ```enough''' elements or to be concrete. In case it is concrete, domains can be identified with sets, maps with func­tions, products $A \times B$ in the category with the corresponding cartesian product of the sets (ask: which $c : \bbone \to A \times B$?), and function spaces $(A \to B)$ with spaces of actual functions (be­ cause there is a one-one correspondence between maps $f : A \to B$ and elements $e: \bbone \to (A \to B)$.

For a theory in the form of a \ccc, to ask whether it has a (non-trivial) model is to ask whether it can be expanded to a concrete \ccc\ by the adjunction of elements (and other maps and additional equations, but no new domains) which is non­ trivial in the sense of not making all domains isomorphic to $\bbone$.

An answer --- though perhaps a rather formal one --- is supplied by the method of adjunction of indeterminates $x: \bbone \to A$ pre­sented in Lambek's paper (this volume). We just have to adjoin infinitely many for each domain, one after the other. Each polynomial involves only finitely many indeterminates. But the results stated by Lambek (esp. Corollary to Theorem 2) show us at once that this expanded category is concrete. The idea is really just like the idea of having ``free algebras'' for any equational theory. (In $\l$-calculus an algebraic equation that is regarded as universally quantified, say $x + y = y + x$, is replaced by the functional equation
$$
\l x \l y . \, x + y = \l x \l y . \, y + x.
$$
%
More thoughts on concreteness will be brought out in Section 4.

That is the (easy) passage from theories to (certain) models.
But remember, a theory is not a model: the maps in a given
\ccc\ are not concrete maps, they are just the definable maps in the language of the theory, and the equations between them are the ``theorems'' of the theory. It is no surprise that a given theory may not have enough definable elements: we may need to expand the stock of elements in order to have a model. For a \ccc\ we find we can. So far, so good; and this is the (known) story of typed $\l$-calculus.

\section{``Type Free'' Domains}

In the paper of Lambek, the analogy between typed and type­ free is illustrated (in the obvious way), but no real connec­ tion or relation is established. This we shall now do, and the relationship will be deepened in the next section.
In the first place, we shall only consider the $\l$-calculus (or $\l K$-calculus) and not the $\l \eta$-calculus; the latter can be re­ garded as a special case. What is needed is a notion of do­main appropriate to the interpretation of the "type-free" cal­culus.

In a category, a retraction between two domains $A$ and $B$ is a pair of maps $i: A	\to B$ and $j : B \to A$ where $j \comp i = \id_A$. Regard $A$ as the "smaller" domain; it is injected into $B$, and $B$ is sur­jectively mapped onto $A$. The notion shares qualities, then, of $A$ being both a subspace of $B$ and at the same time a quotient.
But the injection and surjection have to be related.

Now, suppose that in a cartesian closed category a domain $U$ satisfies the condition that the function space $(U\to U)$ is a retract of the domain $U$ itself. (This is always so for $U = \bbone$, but we seek non-trivial examples.) Let the retraction maps be $i: (U \to U) \to U$ and $j : U \to (U \to U)$. Then $U$ (as it sits in its category) gives us an interpretation of the type-free cal­culus, which we now explain.
Let the type-free terms be constructed in the usual way from variables $x,y,z, \dots$ by means of application and $\l$-abstraction.
Think of all variables as being of type $U$ and define a translation $\tau^*$ from untyped terms to typed terms so that
\begin{align*}
x^* &= x, \\
(\tau(\sigma))^* &= j(\tau^*)(\sigma^*),\\
(\lm{x}.\tau)^* &= i(\lm{x}.\tau^*).
\end{align*}
We intend this in such a way that $\tau^*$ is always of type $U$. The type-free theory (determined by the category, the domain $U$, and by the choice of $i$ and $j$) has as its assertions exactly those equations $\tau = \sigma$ where $\tau^* = \sigma^*$ in the category. The theory satisfies $(\alpha)$, $(\beta)$-conversion-conversion, all the rules of equality, and the rule $\xi$: from $\tau = \sigma$ to deduce $\l x .\, \tau = \l x .\, \sigma$. This much is surely obvious to anyone reading Lambek's paper.

What I would like to point out here is the converse: given any type-free theory, there is a \ccc\ and a domain $U$ (with a suitable retraction pair $i,j$) so that the above interpretation gives exactly the same type-free theory. Consequently, nothing is lost in considering type-free theories just as special parts of typed theories. I do not find this result mentioned by Lam­bek.

The proof is elementary. Let the domains for the category be the $\l$-terms $A$, without free variables, for which we can prove in the theory:
$$
A = \lm{x}. A(A(x)).
$$
The maps $f: A\to B$ are terms $f$ without free variables for which we can prove
$$
f = \lm{x}. B(f(A(x))).
$$
The equations between maps are the equations we can prove in the theory. [Actually, it might be better to construe maps as triples $(A,f,B)$, but never mind.] It is not hard to show that this is a category where
\begin{align*}
\id_A &= A, {\textrm{ and}}\\
f \comp g &= \lm{x}. f(g(x)).
\end{align*}
[More properly spoken, the maps should be equivalence classes of terms based on the equations of theory, but never mind.]
To show this construction gives a \ccc\ we need to define:
$$
A \times B = \lmm{u}{z}.z(A(u(\lxy x))) (B(u(\lxy y))).
$$
where
\begin{align*}
p_{AB} &= \lm{u}. (A \times B)(u)(\lxy x),\\
q_{AB} &= \lm{u}. (A \times B)(u)(\lxy y),
\end{align*}
%
and if $f:C\to A$ and $g: C\to B$ then
$$
\langle f,g \rangle = \lmm{t}{z}.z(f(t))(g(t)).
$$
All of this is based on the familiar pairing functions of $\l$-calculus.

For function spaces, we define
$$
A \to B = \lm{f}. B \comp f \comp A.
$$
where
$$
\ebc = \lm{u}. C(u(\lxy x)(B(u(\lxy y)))).
$$
and
$$
\L_{ABC}\, h = \lxy h(\lm{z}. z(x)(y)).
$$
provided $h: (A \times B) \to C$.

There are a jolly lot of equations to verify, but the work is all straight-forward conversion. The method of retracts as a \ccc\ has in any case been exposed before with respect to the $P\omega$ model in Scott (1976). Note here, however, we are to verify the required equations in a theory (not a model) making use of nothing but the ``logical'' axioms of $\l$-calculus.

It remains to identify the domain $U$ in the constructed cate­gory. We define:
$$
U = \lm{x}. x\, .
$$
Clearly
$$
U = \lm{x}.U(U(x)) = U \comp U .
$$
Note that every A in the category is a retract of U; indeed, for retractions define $A : A \to U$ and $A: U\to A$ and
$$
A \comp A = A = \id_A.
$$
We thus speak of these A's also as retractions. We can write: 
$$
(U\to U) = \lmm{x}{f}. f(x),
$$
and it is thus easy to verify now that $(U\to U)$ is a retraction of $U$. As $U$ is in fact the identity function, the reinterpre­tation via $U$ of the type-free calculus will obviously translate every term into itself.
I just note in writing down the definition of the \ccc, I
forgot to define $\bbone$ --- because it is so dull, I suppose! For this we have to map everything onto a constant:
\begin{align*}
\bbone &= \lmm{u}{x}.x, {\textrm{ and}} \\
\zeromap &= \bbone
\end{align*}
I think the calculations suggested provide an argument that the type-free $\l$-calculus takes {\it second} place to typed $\l$-calculus --- foundationally speaking. Type-free domains are \emph{special kinds} of types. As I have said before in other writings, to get $(U \to U)$ inside $U$, we have to pass to an {\it infinite} type. I thought this was made very clear in the so-called $D_{\infty}$-construction. The category of \emph{continuous lattices and continuous func­tions} is a \ccc. Starting with any domain $D_0$, in that cate­gory the sequence of types $D_n$ where $D_{n+l} =  (D_n \to D_x)$  has a certain limit $D$ with $D_O$ (and all the $D$'s) as retracts, and with $(D_\infty \to D_\infty)$ not only a retract but an isomorph of $D_\infty$
That is one choice of an $U$, and I showed many variations are possible for other type-free domains $U$ in this one category.

We hasten to note that in the \ccc\ of {\it sets and arbitrary functions}, a non-trivial domain $U$ with $(U\to U)$ a retract is im­possible (by cardinality considerations). This means that not all \ccc\ lead directly to interpretations of the type-free theory. Hence, we must conclude, {\it the typed theory is the more general one, and the prior one}.

Such a conclusion will not be welcome, however. The type­ free theory from our experience seems general enough. Even though we have shown two good ways of relating the two kinds of theories, we would like something more. We do not want just some \ccc\ related to a given type-free theory, but we would like to find a relation that achieved any desired \ccc, pro­vided we cook up the type-free one properly. This problem is the topic of the next section.

Before we turn to this new relationship, a word about {\it models} of the type-free calculus would be to the point. There is con­siderable discussion of the notion of a model in Hindley and Longo (1980) and Barendregt (1980) (where other references are given). We should state how this all fits in with the present view.

When presenting a theory in the usual $\l$-notation, free vari­ables are permitted as well as full use of the rule ($\xi$). But, when thinking of elements (relative to a theory) only terms (better: equivalence classes of terms) {\it without free variables} should be considered. As is known from many examples, there may not be enough of them. This can of course be so even if we
allow in our language many non-logical constants. What does
``enough'' mean? Well, if f and g are closed terms, it may be
that $f(a) = g(a)$ is provable for all closed $a$, but $f = g$ is not provable. The fact that this happens for some theories should come as no surprise. (For the explicit examples consult Baren­ dregt (1980).)

The remedy is to adjoin indeterminates (constants without
new axioms) until ``enough'' is reached. (A proof is also found
in Barendregt (1980).) As with the typed calculus, every the­ ory has a model which satisfies exactly the same equations as
are provable in the theory (one might call it a conservative
model).
The notion of a A-mode l has not struck people as quite satisfactory because the extensionality principle in the ``enough'' clause is not very algebraic. A suggestion of mine is mention­ ed in the cited references, but I think it would be useful to recast the idea in the light of the present discussion.

In typed $\l$-calculus, the categorical formulation is one way of eliminating all use of variables. In type-free $\l$-calculus, the usual plan is to use the combinators - and the plan leads to awfully long formulae, Let us not try to give a variable­ free formulation, but talk in terms of first-order models.
What is unalgebraic in the model definition is the $\l$-operator, since a bound variable is of the essence of the use of $\l$, So let us replace $\l$ by the combinators in the usual way. We take $S$ and $K$ as primitive, and a $\l$-model is (at least), a structure of the form $\langle U, \cdot(\cdot), S, K\rangle>$ with a domain, a binary operation, and two distinguished constants, The problem is: {\it what are the axioms}? Clearly we want:
