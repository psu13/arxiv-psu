abstract = {A central feature of quantum mechanics is that a measurement is intrinsically probabilistic. As a result, continuously monitoring a quantum system will randomly perturb its natural unitary evolution. The ability to control a quantum system in the presence of these fluctuations is of increasing importance in quantum information processing and finds application in fields ranging from nuclear magnetic resonance to chemical synthesis. A detailed understanding of this stochastic evolution is essential for the development of optimized control methods. Here we reconstruct the individual quantum trajectories of a superconducting circuit that evolves in competition between continuous weak measurement and driven unitary evolution. By tracking individual trajectories that evolve between an arbitrary choice of initial and final states we can deduce the most probable path through quantum state space. These pre- and post-selected quantum trajectories also reveal the optimal detector signal in the form of a smooth time-continuous function that connects the desired boundary conditions. Our investigation reveals the rich interplay between measurement dynamics, typically associated with wave function collapse, and unitary evolution of the quantum state as described by the Schrodinger equation. These results and the underlying theory, based on a principle of least action, reveal the optimal route from initial to final states, and may enable new quantum control methods for state steering and information processing.},

abstract = {We propose a scheme for implementing cross Kerr nonlinearity between two superconducting transmission line resonators (TLR) via their interaction with a coupler which is constructed by two superconducting charge qubits connected to each other via a superconducting quantum interference device. When suitably driven, the coupler can induce very strong cross phase modulation (XPM) between the two TLRs due to its N-type level structure and the consequent electromagnetically induced transparency in its lowest states. The flexibility of our design can lead to various inter-TLR coupling configurations. The obtained cross Kerr coefficient is large enough to allow many important quantum operations in which only few photons are involved. We further show that this scheme is very robust against the fluctuations in solid state circuits. Our numerical calculations imply that the absorption and dispersion resulted from the decoherence of the coupler are very small compared with the strength of the proposed XPM.},

This architecture is attractive both as a macroscopic analog of atomic physics experiments and for quantum computing and control, since it provides strong inhibition of spontaneous emission, potentially leading to greatly enhanced qubit lifetimes, allows high-fidelity quantum non-demolition measurements of the state of multiple qubits, and has a natural mechanism for entanglement of qubits separated by centimeter distances.

@article{Murch2013,
abstract = {Quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic vacuum are responsible for physical effects such as the Casimir force and the radiative decay of atoms, and set fundamental limits on the sensitivity of measurements. Entanglement between photons can produce correlations that result in a reduction of these fluctuations below the ordinary vacuum level, allowing measurements that surpass the standard quantum limit in sensitivity. The effects of such 'squeezed states' of light on matter were first considered in a prediction of the radiative decay rates of atoms in squeezed vacuum. Despite efforts to demonstrate such effects in experiments with natural atoms, a direct quantitative observation of this prediction has remained elusive. Here we report a twofold reduction of the transverse radiative decay rate of a superconducting artificial atom coupled to continuum squeezed vacuum. The artificial atom is effectively a two-level system formed by the strong interaction between a superconducting circuit and a microwave-frequency cavity. A Josephson parametric amplifier is used to generate quadrature-squeezed electromagnetic vacuum. The observed twofold reduction in the decay rate of the atom allows the transverse coherence time, T2, to exceed the ordinary vacuum decay limit, 2T1. We demonstrate that the measured radiative decay dynamics can be used to reconstruct the Wigner distribution of the itinerant squeezed state. Our results confirm a canonical prediction of quantum optics and should enable new studies of the quantum light-matter interaction.},

We consider the regimes of strong and weak coupling to the detector, and investigate the measurement-induced spin dynamics both analytically and numerically. We observe emergence of the negative-result evolution and the system stabilization due to an analog of quantum Zeno effect. Moreover, unitary evolution between the triplet and a singlet state is induced by the negative-result measurement.

Achieving broadband operation is especially tricky. Macklin et al. engineered an amplifier that contains a long chain of so-called Josephson junctions (see the Perspective by Cleland). The amplifier exhibited high gain over a gigahertz-sized bandwidth and was able to perform high-fidelity qubit readout. Because the amplifier will be capable of reading out as many as 20 qubits simultaneously, it may help to scale up QIP protocols.Science, this issue p. 307; see also p. 280Detecting single{\{}$\backslash$textendash{\}}photon level signals{\{}$\backslash$textemdash{\}}carriers of both classical and quantum information{\{}$\backslash$textemdash{\}}is particularly challenging for low-energy microwave frequency excitations. Here we introduce a superconducting amplifier based on a Josephson junction transmission line. Unlike current standing-wave parametric amplifiers, this traveling wave architecture robustly achieves high gain over a bandwidth of several gigahertz with sufficient dynamic range to read out 20 superconducting qubits. To achieve this performance, we introduce a subwavelength resonant phase-matching technique that enables the creation of nonlinear microwave devices with unique dispersion relations. We benchmark the amplifier with weak measurements, obtaining a high quantum efficiency of 75{\%} (70{\%} including noise added by amplifiers following the Josephson amplifier). With a flexible design based on compact lumped elements, this Josephson amplifier has broad applicability to microwave metrology and quantum optics.},

@article{Ofek2016,
abstract = {The remarkable discovery of Quantum Error Correction (QEC), which can overcome the errors experienced by a bit of quantum information (qubit), was a critical advance that gives hope for eventually realizing practical quantum computers. In principle, a system that implements QEC can actually pass a "break-even" point and preserve quantum information for longer than the lifetime of its constituent parts. Reaching the break-even point, however, has thus far remained an outstanding and challenging goal. Several previous works have demonstrated elements of QEC in NMR, ions, nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, photons, and superconducting transmons. However, these works primarily illustrate the signatures or scaling properties of QEC codes rather than test the capacity of the system to extend the lifetime of quantum information over time. Here we demonstrate a QEC system that reaches the break-even point by suppressing the natural errors due to energy loss for a qubit logically encoded in superpositions of coherent states, or cat states of a superconducting resonator. Moreover, the experiment implements a full QEC protocol by using real-time feedback to encode, monitor naturally occurring errors, decode, and correct. As measured by full process tomography, the enhanced lifetime of the encoded information is 320 microseconds without any post-selection. This is 20 times greater than that of the system's transmon, over twice as long as an uncorrected logical encoding, and 10{\%} longer than the highest quality element of the system (the resonator's 0, 1 Fock states). Our results illustrate the power of novel, hardware efficient qubit encodings over traditional QEC schemes. Furthermore, they advance the field of experimental error correction from confirming the basic concepts to exploring the metrics that drive system performance and the challenges in implementing a fault-tolerant system.},

abstract = {Josephson circuits have been ideal systems to study complex non-linear dynamics which can lead to chaotic behavior and instabilities. More recently, Josephson circuits in the quantum regime, particularly in the presence of microwave drives, have demonstrated their ability to emulate a variety of Hamiltonians that are useful for the processing of quantum information. In this paper we show that these drives lead to an instability which results in the escape of the circuit mode into states that are not confined by the Josephson cosine potential. We observe this escape in a ubiquitous circuit: a transmon embedded in a 3D cavity. When the transmon occupies these free-particle-like states, the circuit behaves as though the junction had been removed, and all non-linearities are lost. This work deepens our understanding of strongly driven Josephson circuits, which is important for fundamental and application perspectives, such as the engineering of Hamiltonians by parametric pumping.},

Here we use superconducting circuits to realize a quantum Maxwell demon in which all thermodynamic quantities can be controlled and measured. Using power detection resolved at the single microwave photon level and unprecedented tomography techniques, we directly measure the extracted work while tracking the qubit and cavity entropies and energies. We are thus able to fully characterize the demon{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s memory after the work extraction and show that it takes full part in the thermodynamic process. The experiment establishes superconducting circuits as a testbed well suited to perform quantum thermodynamics experiments.In apparent contradiction to the laws of thermodynamics, Maxwell{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s demon is able to cyclically extract work from a system in contact with a thermal bath, exploiting the information about its microstate. The resolution of this paradox required the insight that an intimate relationship exists between information and thermodynamics. Here, we realize a Maxwell demon experiment that tracks the state of each constituent in both the classical and quantum regimes. The demon is a microwave cavity that encodes quantum information about a superconducting qubit and converts information into work by powering up a propagating microwave pulse by stimulated emission. Thanks to the high level of control of superconducting circuits, we directly measure the extracted work and quantify the entropy remaining in the demon{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s memory.

abstract = {The irreversible evolution of a microscopic system under measurement is a central feature of quantum theory. From an initial state generally exhibiting quantum uncertainty in the measured observable, the system is projected into a state in which this observable becomes precisely known. Its value is random, with a probability determined by the initial system's state. The evolution induced by measurement (known as 'state collapse') can be progressive, accumulating the effects of elementary state changes. Here we report the observation of such a step-by-step collapse by non-destructively measuring the photon number of a field stored in a cavity. Atoms behaving as microscopic clocks cross the cavity successively. By measuring the light-induced alterations of the clock rate, information is progressively extracted, until the initially uncertain photon number converges to an integer. The suppression of the photon number spread is demonstrated by correlations between repeated measurements. The procedure illustrates all the postulates of quantum measurement (state collapse, statistical results and repeatability) and should facilitate studies of non-classical fields trapped in cavities.},

abstract = {Radio Frequency driven Josephson circuits provide a rich platform to engineer a variety of nonlinear Hamiltonians for superconducting quantum circuits. While Josephson junctions mediate strong interactions between microwave photons, some particular types of interaction Hamiltonians can only be obtained through the application of microwave drives (pumps) at well-chosen frequencies. For various applications, it is important to increase the pump strength without introducing undesired couplings and interferences that limit the fidelity of the operations. In this Letter, we analyze these limitations through the theoretical study of the steady state behavior of the driven-dissipative systems. Our general analysis, based on the Floquet-Markov theory, indicates that the ubiquitous circuit consisting of a transmon coupled to a harmonic oscillator suffers from strong limitations in this regard. In accordance with a parallel experimental study, we find that above a fairly low critical pump power the transmon state escapes the Josephson potential confinement and is sent to a statistical mixture of free-particle like states. Next, we illustrate that by diluting the non-linearity of the Josephson junction through a parallel inductive shunt, the picture changes significantly and one achieves very large dynamic ranges in the pump power. This theoretical study provides the ground for drastic modifications in Josephson circuit designs to be used in parametric Hamiltonian engineering experiments.},

Bell's inequality with two entangled and spatially separated quantum two- level systems (TLS) is often considered as the most prominent demonstration that nature does not obey ?local realism?. Under di?erent but related assumptions of ?macrorealism?, plausible for macroscopic systems, Leggett and Garg derived a similar inequality for a single degree of freedom undergoing coherent oscillations and being measured at successive times. Such a ?Bell's inequality in time?, which should be violated by a quantum TLS, is tested here. In this work, the TLS is a superconducting quantum circuit whose Rabi oscillations are continuously driven while it is continuously and weakly measured. The time correlations present at the detector output agree with quantum-mechanical predictions and violate the inequality by 5 standard deviations.},

The limit evolution equation is shown to spontaneously produce quantum noises terms: we obtain a quantum Langevin equation as limit of the Hamiltonian evolution. For the very first time, these quantum Langevin equations are obtained as the effective limit from repeated to continuous interactions and not only as a model. These results justify the usual quantum Langevin equations considered in continual quantum measurement or in quantum optics. Physically, the typical Hamiltonian allowing this passage to the limit shows up three different parts which correspond to the free evolution, to an analogue of a weak coupling limit part and to a scattering interaction part. We apply these results to give an Hamiltonian description of the von Neumann measurements. We also consider the approximation of continuous time quantum master equations by discrete time ones; in particular we show how any Lindblad generator is naturally obtained as the limit of completely positive maps.},

abstract = {Traumatic brain injury is an increasingly common affliction, although many of its serious repercussions are still underappreciated. A frequent consequence is the development of light-induced pain, or ‘photalgia', which can often lead to prolonged debilitation. The mechanism underlying the sensitivity to light, however, remains unresolved. Since tissue oedema (swelling) is a common feature of traumatic brain injury, we propose that the brainstem oedema, in particular, might sensitize the brainstem trigeminal complex to signals from ocular mechanisms activated in bright light. To assess this hypothesis, we ran high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brainstems of concussion groups with mild and severe photalgia, without photalgia, and healthy controls. The 3D configuration of the brainstem was determined by Tensor-Based Morphometry (TBM) for each participant. The TBM revealed significant deviations in the brainstem morphology of all concussion groups, with a characteristic signature for each group. In particular, concussion without photalgia showed bilateral expansion at the pontine/medulla junction, whereas concussion with photalgia showed mid-pontine shrinkage, consistent with degeneration of nuclei of the trigeminal complex. These results support the hypothesis that brainstem shrinkage/degeneration represents a morphological substrate of the photalgic sensitization of the trigeminal pathway.},

abstract = {Decoherence originates from the leakage of quantum information into external degrees of freedom. For a qubit the two main decoherence channels are relaxation and dephasing. Here, we report an experiment on a superconducting qubit where we retrieve part of the lost information in both of these channels. We demonstrate that raw averaging the corresponding measurement records provides a full quantum tomography of the qubit state where all three components of the effective spin-1/2 are simultaneously measured. From single realizations of the experiment, it is possible to infer the quantum trajectories followed by the qubit state conditioned on relaxation and/or dephasing channels. The incompatibility between these quantum measurements of the qubit leads to observable consequences in the statistics of quantum states. The high level of controllability of superconducting circuits enables us to explore many regimes from the Zeno effect to underdamped Rabi oscillations depending on the relative strengths of driving, dephasing and relaxation.},

abstract = {A continuously monitored quantum system prepared in an excited state will decay to its ground state with an abrupt jump. The jump occurs stochastically on a characteristic time scale T1, the lifetime of the excited state. These quantum jumps, originally envisioned by Bohr, have been observed in trapped atoms and ions, single molecules, photons, and single electrons in cyclotrons. Here we report the first observation of quantum jumps in a macroscopic quantum system, in our case a superconducting "artificial atom" or quantum bit (qubit) coupled to a superconducting microwave cavity. We use a fast, ultralow-noise parametric amplifier to amplify the microwave photons used to probe the qubit state, enabling continuous high-fidelity monitoring of the qubit. This technique represents a major step forward for solid state quantum information processing, potentially enabling quantum error correction and feedback, which are essential for building a quantum computer. Our technology can also be readily integrated into hybrid circuits involving molecular magnets, nitrogen vacancies in diamond, or semiconductor quantum dots.},

@article{Plenio1998,
abstract = {Dissipation, the irreversible loss of energy and coherence, from a microsystem, is the result of coupling to a much larger macrosystem (or reservoir) which is so large that one has no chance of keeping track of all of its degrees of freedom. The microsystem evolution is then described by tracing over the reservoir states, resulting in an irreversible decay as excitation leaks out of the initially excited microsystems into the outer reservoir environment. Earlier treatments of this dissipation described an ensemble of microsystems using density matrices, either in Schroedinger picture with Master equations, or in Heisenberg picture with Langevin equations. The development of experimental techniques to study single quantum systems (for example single trapped ions, or cavity radiation field modes) has stimulated the construction of theoretical methods to describe individual realizations conditioned on a particular observation record of the decay channel, in the environment. These methods, variously described as Quantum Jump, Monte Carlo Wavefunction and Quantum Trajectory methods are the subject of this review article. We discuss their derivation, apply them to a number of current problems in quantum optics and relate them to ensemble descriptions.},

abstract = {Making a system state follow a prescribed trajectory despite fluctuations and errors commonly consists in monitoring an observable (temperature, blood-glucose level...) and reacting on its controllers (heater power, insulin amount ...). In the quantum domain, there is a change of paradigm in feedback since measurements modify the state of the system, most dramatically when the trajectory goes through superpositions of measurement eigenstates. Here, we demonstrate the stabilization of an arbitrary trajectory of a superconducting qubit by measurement based feedback. The protocol benefits from the long coherence time ({\$}T{\_}2{\textgreater}10 \backslashmu{\$}s) of the 3D transmon qubit, the high efficiency (82{\%}) of the phase preserving Josephson amplifier, and fast electronics ensuring less than 500 ns delay. At discrete time intervals, the state of the qubit is measured and corrected in case an error is detected. For Rabi oscillations, where the discrete measurements occur when the qubit is supposed to be in the measurement pointer states, we demonstrate an average fidelity of 85{\%} to the targeted trajectory. For Ramsey oscillations, which does not go through pointer states, the average fidelity reaches 75{\%}. Incidentally, we demonstrate a fast reset protocol allowing to cool a 3D transmon qubit down to 0.6{\%} in the excited state.},

abstract = {The act of measurement bridges the quantum and classical worlds by projecting a superposition of possible states into a single (probabilistic) outcome. The timescale of this 'instantaneous' process can be stretched using weak measurements, such that it takes the form of a gradual random walk towards a final state. Remarkably, the interim measurement record is sufficient to continuously track and steer the quantum state using feedback. Here we implement quantum feedback control in a solid-state system, namely a superconducting quantum bit (qubit) coupled to a microwave cavity. A weak measurement of the qubit is implemented by probing the cavity with microwave photons, maintaining its average occupation at less than one photon. These photons are then directed to a high-bandwidth, quantum-noise-limited amplifier, which allows real-time monitoring of the state of the cavity (and, hence, that of the qubit) with high fidelity. We demonstrate quantum feedback control by inhibiting the decay of Rabi oscillations, allowing them to persist indefinitely. Such an ability permits the active suppression of decoherence and enables a method of quantum error correction based on weak continuous measurements. Other applications include quantum state stabilization, entanglement generation using measurement, state purification and adaptive measurements.},

abstract = {We have measured the plasma resonances of an array of Josephson junctions in the regime E JE C, up to the ninth harmonic by incorporating it as part of a resonator capacitively coupled to a coplanar waveguide. From the characteristics of the resonances, we infer the successful implementation of a superinductance, an electrical element with a nondissipative impedance greater than the resistance quantum [R Q=h (2e)26.5k$\Omega$] at microwave frequencies. Such an element is crucial for preserving the quantum coherence in circuits exploiting large fluctuations of the superconducting phase. Our results show internal losses less than 20ppm, self-resonant frequencies greater than 10GHz, and phase-slip rates less than 1mHz, enabling direct application of such arrays for quantum information and metrology. Arrays with a loop geometry also demonstrate a new manifestation of flux quantization in a dispersive analog of the Little-Parks effect. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

We further employ a novel quantum feedback loop to compensate for the exchanged heat and effectively isolate the qubit.

abstract = {Quantum error correction codes are designed to protect an arbitrary state of a multi-qubit register from decoherence-induced errors, but their implementation is an outstanding challenge in the development of large-scale quantum computers. The first step is to stabilize a non-equilibrium state of a simple quantum system, such as a quantum bit (qubit) or a cavity mode, in the presence of decoherence. This has recently been accomplished using measurement-based feedback schemes. The next step is to prepare and stabilize a state of a composite system. Here we demonstrate the stabilization of an entangled Bell state of a quantum register of two superconducting qubits for an arbitrary time. Our result is achieved using an autonomous feedback scheme that combines continuous drives along with a specifically engineered coupling between the two-qubit register and a dissipative reservoir. Similar autonomous feedback techniques have been used for qubit reset, single-qubit state stabilization, and the creation and stabilization of states of multipartite quantum systems. Unlike conventional, measurement-based schemes, the autonomous approach uses engineered dissipation to counteract decoherence, obviating the need for a complicated external feedback loop to correct errors. Instead, the feedback loop is built into the Hamiltonian such that the steady state of the system in the presence of drives and dissipation is a Bell state, an essential building block for quantum information processing. Such autonomous schemes, which are broadly applicable to a variety of physical systems, as demonstrated by the accompanying paper on trapped ion qubits, will be an essential tool for the implementation of quantum error correction.},

We demonstrated single-shot, projective measurement of a single nuclear spin in diamond using a quantum nondemolition measurement scheme, which allows real-time observation of an individual nuclear spin's state in a room-temperature solid.

abstract = {The implementation of a Lambda scheme in superconducting artificial atoms could allow detection of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) and other quantum manipulations in the microwave regime. However, symmetries which on one hand protect the system against decoherence yield selection rules which may cancel coupling to the pump external drive. The tradeoff between efficient coupling and decoherence due to broad-band colored noise (BBCN), which is often the main source of decoherence, is addressed in the class of nanodevices based on the Cooper pair box (CPB) design.We study transfer efficiency by STIRAP, showing that substantial efficiency is achieved for off-symmetric bias only in the charge-phase regime. We find a number of results uniquely due to non-Markovianity of BBCN, namely (a) the efficiency for STIRAP depends essentially on noise channels in the trapped subspace; (b) low-frequency fluctuations can be analyzed and represented as fictitious correlated fluctuations of the detunings of the external drives; and (c) a simple figure ofmerit for design and operating prescriptions allowing the observation of STIRAP is proposed. The emerging physical picture also applies to other classes of coherent nanodevices subject to BBCN. DOI:},

abstract = {We use homodyne detection to monitor the radiative decay of a superconducting qubit. According to the classical theory of conditional probabilities, the excited state population differs from an exponential decay law if it is conditioned upon a later projective qubit measurement. Quantum trajectory theory accounts for the expectation values of general observables, and we use experimental data to show how a homodyne detection signal is conditioned upon both the initial state and the finally projected state of a decaying qubit. We observe, in particular, how anomalous weak values occur in continuous weak measurement for certain pre- and post-selected states. Subject to homodyne detection, the density matrix evolves in a stochastic manner, but it is restricted to a specific surface in the Bloch sphere. We show that a similar restriction applies to the information associated with the post-selection, and thus bounds the predictions of the theory.},

@article{Sun2013,
abstract = {Quantum error correction (QEC) is required for a practical quantum computer because of the fragile nature of quantum information. In QEC, information is redundantly stored in a large Hilbert space and one or more observables must be monitored to reveal the occurrence of an error, without disturbing the information encoded in an unknown quantum state. Such observables, typically multi-qubit parities such as {\textless}XXXX{\textgreater}, must correspond to a special symmetry property inherent to the encoding scheme. Measurements of these observables, or error syndromes, must also be performed in a quantum non-demolition (QND) way and faster than the rate at which errors occur. Previously, QND measurements of quantum jumps between energy eigenstates have been performed in systems such as trapped ions, electrons, cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, and superconducting qubits. So far, however, no fast and repeated monitoring of an error syndrome has been realized. Here, we track the quantum jumps of a possible error syndrome, the photon number parity of a microwave cavity, by mapping this property onto an ancilla qubit. This quantity is just the error syndrome required in a recently proposed scheme for a hardware-efficient protected quantum memory using Schr$\backslash$"{\{}o{\}}dinger cat states in a harmonic oscillator. We demonstrate the projective nature of this measurement onto a parity eigenspace by observing the collapse of a coherent state onto even or odd cat states. The measurement is fast compared to the cavity lifetime, has a high single-shot fidelity, and has a 99.8{\%} probability per single measurement of leaving the parity unchanged. In combination with the deterministic encoding of quantum information in cat states realized earlier, our demonstrated QND parity tracking represents a significant step towards implementing an active system that extends the lifetime of a quantum bit.},

abstract = {In the study of open quantum systems modeled by a unitary evolution of a bipartite Hilbert space, we address the question of which parts of the environment can be said to have a “classical action” on the system, in the sense of acting as a classical stochastic process. Our method relies on the definition of the Environment Algebra, a relevant von Neumann algebra of the environment. With this algebra we define the classical parts of the environment and prove a decomposition between a maximal classical part and a quantum part. Then we investigate what other information can be obtained via this algebra, which leads us to define a more pertinent algebra: the Environment Action Algebra. This second algebra is linked to the minimal Stinespring representations induced by the unitary evolution on the system. Finally, in finite dimension we give a characterization of both algebras in terms of the spectrum of a certain completely positive map acting on the states of the environment.},

abstract = {The quantum Zeno effect is the suppression of Hamiltonian evolution by repeated observation, resulting in the pinning of the state to an eigenstate of the measurement observable. Using measurement only, control of the state can be achieved if the observable is slowly varied such that the state tracks the now time-dependent eigenstate. We demonstrate this using a circuit-QED readout technique that couples to a dynamically controllable observable of a qubit. Continuous monitoring of the measurement record allows us to detect an escape from the eigenstate, thus serving as a built-in form of error detection. We show this by post-selecting on realizations with arbitrarily high fidelity with respect to the target state. Our dynamical measurement operator technique offers a new tool for numerous forms of quantum feedback protocols, including adaptive measurements and rapid state purification.},

Here we demonstrate the preparation of arbitrary three level superposition states using optimal control techniques in a transmon.

abstract = {The stochastic evolution of quantum systems during measurement is arguably the most enigmatic feature of quantum mechanics. Measuring a quantum system typically steers it towards a classical state, destroying the coherence of an initial quantum superposition and the entanglement with other quantum systems. Remarkably, the measurement of a shared property between non-interacting quan-tum systems can generate entanglement, starting from an uncorre-lated state. Of special interest in quantum computing is the parity measurement 1 , which projects the state of multiple qubits (quantum bits) to a state with an even or odd number of excited qubits. A parity meter must discern the two qubit-excitation parities with high fidelity while preserving coherence between same-parity states. Despite nume-rous proposals for atomic 2 , semiconducting 1,3–7 and superconduct-ing qubits 8,9 , realizing a parity meter that creates entanglement for both even and odd measurement results has remained an outstand-ing challenge. Here we perform a time-resolved, continuous parity measurement of two superconducting qubits using the cavity in a three-dimensional circuit quantum electrodynamics 10,11 architec-ture and phase-sensitive parametric amplification 12},

However for the simplest system capable of exhibiting contextuality, a qutrit, the quantum contextuality is verified only state-dependently in experiment because too many (at least 31) observables are involved in all the known state-independent tests. Here we report an experimentally testable inequality involving only 13 observables that is satisfied by all non-contextual realistic models while being violated by all qutrit states. Thus our inequality will practically facilitate a state-independent test of the quantum contextuality for an indivisible quantum system. We provide also a record-breaking state-independent proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem with 13 directions determined by 26 points on the surface of a three by three magic cube.},

abstract = {In quantum physics, measurement results are random but their statistics can be predicted assuming some knowledge about the system in the past. Additional knowledge from a future measurement deeply changes the statistics in the present and leads to purely quantum features. In particular conditioned average outcomes of a weak measurement, so-called weak values, were shown to go beyond the conventional range, give a way to directly measure complex quantities, and can be used to enhance the sensitivity of quantum meters. Recently, these concepts have been considered in the general case of open quantum systems where decoherence occurs. Then, what are the properties of weak values for the unavoidable measurement associated to decoherence, the one performed by the environment? Here, we answer this question in the simplest open quantum system: a quantum bit in presence of a relaxation channel. We continuously monitor the fluorescence emitted by a superconducting qubit driven at resonance. Conditioned on initial preparation and final single shot measurement outcome of the qubit state, we probe weak values displaying all the above properties. The fluorescence signal exhibits interferences between oscillations associated to past and future quantum states. The measured data are in complete agreement with theory.},

abstract = {Feedback loops are central to most classical control procedures. A controller compares the signal measured by a sensor (system output) with the target value or set-point. It then adjusts an actuator (system input) to stabilize the signal around the target value. Generalizing this scheme to stabilize a micro-system's quantum state relies on quantum feedback 1–3 , which must overcome a fundamental dif-ficulty: the sensor measurements cause a random back-action on the system. An optimal compromise uses weak measurements 4,5 , providing partial information with minimal perturbation. The con-troller should include the effect of this perturbation in the computa-tion of the actuator's operation, which brings the incrementally perturbed state closer to the target. Although some aspects of this scenario have been experimentally demonstrated for the control of quantum 6–9 or classical 10,11 micro-system variables, continuous feed-back loop operations that permanently stabilize quantum systems around a target state have not yet been realized. Here we have imple-mented such a real-time stabilizing quantum feedback scheme 12 fol-lowing a method inspired by ref. 13. It prepares on demand photon number states (Fock states) of a microwave field in a superconduct-ing cavity, and subsequently reverses the effects of decoherence-induced field quantum jumps 14–16},

abstract = {The study of resonant dielectric nanostructures with high refractive index is a new research direction in nanoscale optics and metamaterial-inspired nanophotonics. Because of the unique optically-induced electric and magnetic Mie resonances, high-index nanoscale structures are expected to complement or even replace different plasmonic components in a range of potential applications. Here we study strong coupling between modes of a single subwavelength high-index dielectric resonator and analyse the mode transformation and Fano resonances when resonator's aspect ratio varies. We demonstrate that strong mode coupling results in resonances with high quality factors, which are related to the physics of bound states in the continuum when the radiative losses are almost suppressed due to the Friedrich-Wintgen scenario of destructive interference. We reveal a fundamental link between the formation of the high-quality resonances and peculiarities of the Fano parameter in the scattering cross-section spectra. Our theoretical findings are confirmed by microwave experiments for the scattering of a high-index cylindrical resonators with a tunable aspect ratio. The proposed mechanism of the strong mode coupling in single subwavelength high-index resonators accompanied by resonances with high quality factor helps to extend substantially functionalities of all-dielectric nanophotonics that opens new horizons for active and passive nanoscale metadevices.},

In our circuit the Josephson effect introduces strong couplings between the two normal modes of the artificial atom.

Here we present fast multiplexed readout of five qubits in a single 1.2 GHz wide readout channel. Using a readout pulse length of 80 ns and populating readout resonators for less than 250 ns we find an average correct assignment probability for the five measured qubits to be {\$}97\backslash{\%}{\$}. The differences between the individual readout errors and those found when measuring the qubits simultaneously are within {\$}1\backslash{\%}{\$}. We employ individual Purcell filters for each readout resonator to suppress off-resonant driving, which we characterize by the dephasing imposed on unintentionally measured qubits. We expect the here presented readout scheme to become particularly useful for the selective readout of individual qubits in multi-qubit quantum processors.},

abstract = {Initialization and read-out of coupled quantum systems are essential ingredients for the implementation of quantum algorithms. Single-shot read-out of the state of a multi-quantum-bit (multi-qubit) register would allow direct investigation of quantum correlations (entanglement), and would give access to further key resources such as quantum error correction and deterministic quantum teleportation. Although spins in solids are attractive candidates for scalable quantum information processing, their single-shot detection has been achieved only for isolated qubits. Here we demonstrate the preparation and measurement of a multi-spin quantum register in a low-temperature solid-state system by implementing resonant optical excitation techniques originally developed in atomic physics. We achieve high-fidelity read-out of the electronic spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond, and use this read-out to project up to three nearby nuclear spin qubits onto a well-defined state. Conversely, we can distinguish the state of the nuclear spins in a single shot by mapping it onto, and subsequently measuring, the electronic spin. Finally, we show compatibility with qubit control: we demonstrate initialization, coherent manipulation and single-shot read-out in a single experiment on a two-qubit register, using techniques suitable for extension to larger registers. These results pave the way for a test of Bell's inequalities on solid-state spins and the implementation of measurement-based quantum information protocols.},

In this article, we report the first realization of an intrinsically phase-preserving, non-degenerate superconducting parametric amplifier, a so far missing component. It is based on the Josephson ring modulator, which consists of four junctions in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. The device symmetry greatly enhances the purity of the amplification process and simplifies both its operation and analysis. The measured characteristics of the amplifier in terms of gain and bandwidth are in good agreement with analytical predictions. Using a newly developed noise source, we also show that our device operates within a factor of three of the quantum limit. This development opens new applications in the area of quantum analog signal processing.},

A necessary condition for this is that the information carried away from the system by the bath (source of the irreversibility) be recoverable. The primary field of application is quantum optics, where the bath consists of the continuum of electromagnetic modes. The information lost from the system can be recovered using a perfect photodetector. The state of the system conditioned on the photodetections undergoes stochastic quantum jumps. Alternative measurement schemes on the outgoing light (homodyne and heterodyne detection) are shown to give rise to SSE's with diffusive terms. These three detection schemes are illustrated on a simple quantum system, the two-level atom, giving new perspectives on the interpretation of measurement results. The reality of these and other stochastic processes for state vectors is discussed.},

abstract = {The state of a microscopic system encodes its complete quantum description, from which the probabilities of all measurement outcomes are inferred. Being a statistical concept, the state cannot be obtained from a single system realization, but can instead be reconstructed from an ensemble of copies through measurements on different realizations. Reconstructing the state of a set of trapped particles shielded from their environment is an important step in the investigation of the quantum-classical boundary. Although trapped-atom state reconstructions have been achieved, it is challenging to perform similar experiments with trapped photons because cavities that can store light for very long times are required. Here we report the complete reconstruction and pictorial representation of a variety of radiation states trapped in a cavity in which several photons survive long enough to be repeatedly measured. Atoms crossing the cavity one by one are used to extract information about the field. We obtain images of coherent states, Fock states with a definite photon number and 'Schr{\"{o}}dinger cat' states (superpositions of coherent states with different phases). These states are equivalently represented by their density matrices or Wigner functions. Quasi-classical coherent states have a Gaussian-shaped Wigner function, whereas the Wigner functions of Fock and Schr{\"{o}}dinger cat states show oscillations and negativities revealing quantum interferences. Cavity damping induces decoherence that quickly washes out such oscillations. We observe this process and follow the evolution of decoherence by reconstructing snapshots of Schr{\"{o}}dinger cat states at successive times. Our reconstruction procedure is a useful tool for further decoherence and quantum feedback studies of fields trapped in one or two cavities.},

abstract = {In the circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture, both the resonance frequency and the coupling of superconducting qubits to microwave field modes can be controlled via external electric and magnetic fields to explore qubit -- photon dynamics in a wide parameter range. Here, we experimentally demonstrate and analyze a scheme for tuning the coupling between a transmon qubit and a microwave resonator using a single coherent drive tone. We treat the transmon as a three-level system with the qubit subspace defined by the ground and the second excited states. If the drive frequency matches the difference between the resonator and the qubit frequency, a Jaynes-Cummings type interaction is induced, which is tunable both in amplitude and phase. We show that coupling strengths of about 10 MHz can be achieved in our setup, limited only by the anharmonicity of the transmon qubit. This scheme has been successfully used to generate microwave photons with controlled temporal shape [Pechal et al., Phys. Rev. X 4, 041010 (2014)] and can be directly implemented with superconducting quantum devices featuring larger anharmonicity for higher coupling strengths.},

We provide a pedagogical overview of the measurement process, when the qubit is dispersively coupled to a microwave frequency cavity, and the qubit state is encoded in the phase of a microwave tone that probes the cavity. A continuous measurement record is used to reconstruct the individual quantum trajectories of the qubit state, and quantum state tomography is performed to verify that the state has been tracked accurately. Furthermore, we discuss ensembles of trajectories, time-symmetric evolution, two-qubit trajectories, and potential applications in measurement-based quantum error correction.},

abstract = {We propose an experiment which demonstrates the undoing of a weak continuous measurement of a solid-state qubit, so that any unknown initial state is fully restored. The undoing procedure has only a finite probability of success because of the nonunitary nature of quantum measurement, though it is accompanied by a clear experimental indication of whether or not the undoing has been successful. The probability of success decreases with increasing strength of the measurement, reaching zero for a traditional projective measurement. Measurement undoing ("quantum undemolition") may be interpreted as a kind of quantum eraser, in which the information obtained from the first measurement is erased by the second measurement, which is an essential part of the undoing procedure. The experiment can be realized using quantum dot (charge) or superconducting (phase) qubits.},

abstract = {A recent experiment by Minev et. al [arXiv:1803.00545] demonstrated that in a dissipative (artificial) 3-level atom with strongly intermittent dynamics it is possible to "catch and reverse" a quantum jump "mid-flight": by the conditional application of a unitary perturbation after a fixed time with no jumps, the system was prevented from getting shelved in the dark state, thus removing the intermittency from the dynamics. Here we offer an interpretation of this phenomenon in terms of the dynamical large deviation formalism for open quantum dynamics. In this approach, intermittency is seen as the first-order coexistence of active and inactive dynamical phases. Dark periods are thus like space-time bubbles of the inactive phase in the active one. Here we consider a controlled dynamics via the (single - as in the experiment - or multiple) application of a unitary control pulse during no-jump periods. By considering the large deviation statistics of the emissions, we show that appropriate choice of the control allows to stabilise a desired dynamical phase and remove the intermittency. In the thermodynamic analogy, the effect of the control is to prick bubbles thus preventing the fluctuations that manifest phase coexistence. We discuss similar controlled dynamics in broader settings.},

abstract = {Large-scale quantum information processors or quantum communication networks will require reliable exchange of information between spatially separated nodes. The links connecting these nodes can be established using traveling photons that need to be absorbed at the receiving node with high efficiency. This is achievable by shaping the temporal profile of the photons and absorbing them at the receiver by time reversing the emission process. Here, we demonstrate a scheme for creating shaped microwave photons using a superconducting transmon-type three-level system coupled to a transmission line resonator. In a second-order process induced by a modulated microwave drive, we controllably transfer a single excitation from the third level of the transmon to the resonator and shape the emitted photon. We reconstruct the density matrices of the created single-photon states and show that the photons are antibunched. We also create multipeaked photons with a controlled amplitude and phase. In contrast to similar existing schemes, the one we present here is based solely on microwave drives, enabling operation with fixed frequency transmons.},

We couple these distinct types of dynamics together by linearly feeding the collected record for dispersive energy measurements directly back into a coherent Rabi drive amplitude. Such feed-back turns the competition cooperative, and effectively stabilizes the qubit state near a target state. We derive the conditions for obtaining such dispersive state stabilization and verify the stabiliza-tion conditions numerically. We include common experimental nonidealities, such as energy decay, environmental dephasing, detector efficiency, and feedback delay, and show that the feedback delay has the most significant negative effect on the feedback protocol. Setting the measurement collapse timescale to be long compared to the feedback delay yields the best stabilization.},

We have fabricated Al/AlO(x)/Al Josephson junctions, phase qubit and capacitors using a 100 kV e-beam writer. Although this high voltage enables a precise control of the undercut, implementation using a conventional 20 kV e-beam is also discussed. The phase qubit coherence times, extracted from spectroscopy resonance width, Rabi and Ramsey oscillation decays and energy relaxation measurements, are longer than the ones obtained in our previous samples realized by standard techniques. These results demonstrate the high quality of the junction obtained by this bridge-free technique.},

abstract = {A qubit can relax by fluorescence, which prompts the release of a photon into its electromagnetic environment. By counting the emitted photons, discrete quantum jumps of the qubit state can be observed. The succession of states occupied by the qubit in a single experiment, its quantum trajectory, depends in fact on the kind of detector. How are the quantum trajectories modified if one measures continuously the amplitude of the fluorescence field instead? Using a superconducting parametric amplifier, we have performed heterodyne detection of the fluorescence of a superconducting qubit. For each realization of the measurement record, we can reconstruct a different quantum trajectory for the qubit. The observed evolution obeys quantum state diffusion, which is characteristic of quantum measurements subject to zero point fluctuations. Independent projective measurements of the qubit at various times provide a quantitative validation of the reconstructed trajectories. By exploring the statistics of quantum trajectories, we demonstrate that the qubit states span a deterministic surface in the Bloch sphere at each time in the evolution. Additionally, we show that when monitoring fluorescence, coherent superpositions are generated during the decay from excited to ground state. Counterintuitively, measuring light emitted during relaxation can give rise to trajectories with increased excitation probability.},

abstract = {Experimental quantum information processing with superconducting circuits is rapidly advancing, driven by innovation in two classes of devices, one involving planar micro-fabricated (2D) resonators, and the other involving machined three-dimensional (3D) cavities. We demonstrate that circuit quantum electrodynamics can be implemented in a multilayer superconducting structure that combines 2D and 3D advantages. We employ standard micro-fabrication techniques to pattern each layer, and rely on a vacuum gap between the layers to store the electromagnetic energy. Planar qubits are lithographically defined as an aperture in a conducting boundary of the resonators. We demonstrate the aperture concept by implementing an integrated, two cavity-modes, one transmon-qubit system.},

The fluorescence of the qubit is detected via a phase preserving heterodyne measurement, giving the fluorescence quadrature signals as two continuous qubit readout results. Using the stochastic path integral approach to the measurement physics, we derive most likely paths between boundary conditions on the state, and compute approximate time correlation functions between all stochastic variables via diagrammatic perturbation theory. We focus on paths that increase in energy during the continuous measurement. Our results are compared to Monte Carlo numerical simulation of the trajectories, and we find close agreement between direct simulation and theory. We generalize this analysis to arbitrary diffusive quantum systems that are continuously monitored.},

Here we define a smoothed quantum state for a partially monitored open quantum system, conditioned on an all-time monitoring-derived record. We calculate the smoothed distribution for a hypothetical unobserved record which, when added to the real record, would complete the monitoring, yielding a pure-state "quantum trajectory". Averaging the pure state over this smoothed distribution yields the (mixed) smoothed quantum state. We study how the choice of actual unravelling affects the purity increase over that of the conventional (filtered) state conditioned only on the past record.},

abstract = {Dephasing induced by residual thermal photons in the readout resonator is a leading factor limiting the coherence times of qubits in the circuit QED architecture. This residual thermal population, of the order of {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}--{\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}, is suspected to arise from noise impinging on the resonator from its input and output ports. To address this problem, we designed and tested a new type of band-pass microwave attenuator that consists of a dissipative cavity well thermalized to the mixing chamber stage of a dilution refrigerator. By adding such a cavity attenuator inline with a 3D superconducting cavity housing a transmon qubit, we have reproducibly measured increased qubit coherence times. At base temperature, through Hahn echo experiment, we measured {\$}T{\_}{\{}2\backslashmathrm{\{}e{\}}{\}}/2T{\_}1 = 1.0\backslash,({\{}+0.0{\}}/{\{}-0.1{\}}){\$} for two qubits over multiple cooldowns. Through noise-induced dephasing measurement, we obtained an upper bound {\$}2\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}{\$} on the residual photon population in the fundamental mode of the readout cavity, which to our knowledge is the lowest value reported so far. These results validate an effective method for protecting qubits against photon noise, which can be developed into a standard technology for quantum circuit experiments.},

In this paper, we use a three-level superconducting system (a qutrit) coupled to a microwave cavity to explore different regimes of quantum measurement. In particular, we engineer the dispersive shifts of the cavity frequency to be identical for the first and second excited states of the qutrit which allows us to realize a strong projective binary-outcome measurement onto its ground state with a fidelity of 94.3{\%}. Complemented with standard microwave control and low-noise parametric amplification, this scheme can be used to create sets of compatible measurements to reveal the contextual nature of superconducting circuits.},

@article{Murch2013a,
abstract = {The length of time that a quantum system can exist in a superposition state is determined by how strongly it interacts with its environment. This interaction entangles the quantum state with the inherent fluctuations of the environment. If these fluctuations are not measured, the environment can be viewed as a source of noise, causing random evolution of the quantum system from an initially pure state into a statistical mixture-a process known as decoherence. However, by accurately measuring the environment in real time, the quantum system can be maintained in a pure state and its time evolution described by a quantum trajectory conditioned on the measurement outcome. We employ weak measurements to monitor a microwave cavity embedding a superconducting qubit and track the individual quantum trajectories of the system. In this architecture, the environment is dominated by the fluctuations of a single electromagnetic mode of the cavity. Using a near-quantum-limited parametric amplifier, we selectively measure either the phase or amplitude of the cavity field, and thereby confine trajectories to either the equator or a meridian of the Bloch sphere. We perform quantum state tomography at discrete times along the trajectory to verify that we have faithfully tracked the state of the quantum system as it diffuses on the surface of the Bloch sphere. Our results demonstrate that decoherence can be mitigated by environmental monitoring and validate the foundations of quantum feedback approaches based on Bayesian statistics. Moreover, our experiments suggest a new route for implementing what Schrodinger termed "quantum steering"-harnessing action at a distance to manipulate quantum states via measurement.},
