\begin{abstract}
\medskip\medskip
Quantum physics was invented to account for  
 two fundamental features of measurement results — their discreetness and  randomness. Emblematic of these features is Bohr’s idea of quantum jumps between two discrete energy levels of an atom\cite{Bohr1913}. Experimentally, quantum jumps were first observed in an  atomic ion driven by a weak deterministic force while under strong continuous energy measurement\cite{Nagourney1986, Sauter1986, Bergquist1986}. The times at which the discontinuous jump transitions occur are reputed to be fundamentally unpredictable. 
Can there be, despite the indeterminism of quantum physics, a possibility to know if a quantum jump is about to occur or not?
Here, we answer this question affirmatively by experimentally demonstrating that the  jump from the ground to an excited state of a superconducting artificial three-level atom can be tracked as it follows a predictable ``flight,'' 
by monitoring the population of an auxiliary energy level coupled to the ground state.  The experimental results demonstrate that the jump evolution when completed is continuous, coherent, and deterministic. Furthermore, exploiting these features and using real-time monitoring and feedback, we catch and reverse a quantum jump mid-flight, thus deterministically preventing its completion. 
Our results, which agree with theoretical predictions essentially without adjustable parameters,  support the modern quantum trajectory theory\cite{Carmichael1993, Gardiner1992-original-traj, Dalibard1992-original-traj, Plenio1998, Korotkov1999-original-traj} and  provide new ground for the exploration of real-time intervention techniques in the control of quantum systems, such as early detection of error syndromes.

\maketitle

Bohr conceived of quantum jumps \cite{Bohr1913} in 1913, and while Einstein elevated their hypothesis to the level of a quantitative rule with his AB coefficient theory\cite{Einstein1916, Einstein1917}, Schr\"{o}dinger strongly objected to their existence\cite{Schrodinger1952}. The nature and existence of quantum jumps remained a subject of controversy for seven decades until they were directly observed in a single system \cite{Nagourney1986, Sauter1986, Bergquist1986}. 
Since then, quantum jumps have been observed in a variety of  atomic\cite{Basche1995, Peil1999, Gleyzes2007, Guerlin2007} and solid-state \cite{Jelezko2002, Neumann2010, Robledo2011, Vijay2011, Hatridge2013} systems.  
Recently,  quantum jumps have been recognized as an essential phenomenon in quantum feedback  control \cite{Deleglise2008, Sayrin2001}, and in particular, for detecting and correcting decoherence-induced errors in quantum information systems \cite{Sun2013, Ofek2016}.

\textbf{Principle of the experiment.} 
\textbf{a,} 
Three-level atom possessing a hidden transition (shaded region) between its ground $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ and dark $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ state, driven by Rabi drive $\Omega_\mathrm{DG}(t)$.
Quantum jumps between $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ and $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ are indirectly monitored by a stronger Rabi drive $\Omega_\mathrm{BG}$ between $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ and the bright state $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$, whose occupancy is continuously monitored at rate $\Gamma$ by an auxiliary oscillator (LC circuit on right), itself measured in reflection by  continuous-wave microwave light (depicted in light blue). 
When the atom is in $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$,  the LC circuit resonance frequency shifts to a lower frequency than when the atom is in $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ or $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ (effect schematically represented by switch). 
Therefore, the probe tone performs a $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$/not-$\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ measurement on the atom, and is blind to any superposition of  $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ and $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$.
\textbf{b,}  
The actual atom and LC oscillator used in the experiment is a superconducting circuit consisting of two strongly-hybridized transmon qubits placed inside a readout resonator cavity at 15\,mK.
Control signals for the atom and cavity are supplied by a room-temperature field-programmable gate array (FPGA) controller.
This fast electronics  monitors the reflected signal from the cavity, and after demodulation and filtering, actuates the control signals.

Here, we focus on the canonical  case of quantum jumps between two levels indirectly monitored by a third --- the case that corresponds to the original observation of quantum jumps in atomic physics\cite{Nagourney1986, Sauter1986, Bergquist1986}, see the level diagram of Fig.~1a.  
A surprising prediction emerges according to quantum trajectory theory:\cite{Carmichael1993, Porrati1987, Ruskov2007} not only does the state of the system evolve continuously during the jump between the ground $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ and excited $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ state, but  it is predicted that there is always a latency period prior to the jump, during which it is possible to acquire a signal that warns of the imminent occurrence of the jump (see Supplement Sec.~IIA).
This advance warning signal consists of a rare, particular lull in the excitation of the ancilla state $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$.
The acquisition of this signal requires the time-resolved, fully efficient detection of  \textit{every} de-excitation of $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$.
Exploiting the specific advantages of superconducting artificial atoms and their  quantum-limited readout chain, we designed an experiment that implements with maximum fidelity and minimum delay the detection of the  advance warning signal occurring before the quantum jump  (see rest of Fig.~1).



First, we developed a superconducting artificial atom with the necessary V-shape level structure (see Fig.~1a and Methods). It consists, besides the ground level $\ket{\mathrm G}$,  of one protected, dark level $\ket{\mathrm D}$ ---  engineered to not couple to any dissipative environment or any measurement apparatus 
 ---  and one ancilla level $\ket{\mathrm B}$, whose occupation is monitored at rate $\Gamma$.
Quantum jumps between $\left|\mathrm G\right>$ and $\left|\mathrm D\right>$ are induced by a weak Rabi drive $\Omega_{\mathrm{DG}}$ --- although this drive might eventually be turned off during the jump, as explained later.
Since a direct measurement of the dark level is not feasible, the jumps are monitored using the Dehmelt shelving scheme\cite{Nagourney1986}.
Thus, the occupation of $\left|\mathrm G\right>$  is linked to  that of $\left|\mathrm B\right>$ by the strong Rabi drive $\Omega_{\mathrm{BG}}$ ($ \Omega_{\mathrm{DG}} \ll \Omega_{\mathrm{BG}} \ll \Gamma $). 
In the atomic physics shelving scheme\cite{Nagourney1986, Sauter1986, Bergquist1986}, an excitation to $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ is recorded by detecting the emitted photons from $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ with a photodetector. From the detection events --- referred to in the following as ``clicks'' --- one infers the occupation of  $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$. On the other hand, from the prolonged absence of clicks (to be defined precisely below; see also Supplement Sec.~II), one infers that a quantum jump from $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ to $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ has occurred.
Due to the poor collection efficiency and dead-time of photon counters in atomic physics\cite{Volz2011}, it is exceedingly difficult to detect every individual click required to faithfully register the origin in time of the advance warning signal.
However, superconducting systems present the advantage of high collection efficiencies\cite{Riste2013, Murch2013, Weber2014}, as  their microwave photons are emitted into one-dimensional waveguides  and are detected with the same detection efficiencies as optical photons.
Furthermore, rather than monitoring the direct fluorescence of the $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ state, we monitor its occupation by dispersively coupling it to an ancilla readout cavity. 
This further improves the fidelity of the detection of the  de-excitation from $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ (effective collection  efficiency of  photons emitted from $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$).

The readout cavity, schematically depicted in Fig.~1a by an LC circuit, is resonant at $\omega_\mathrm{C} = 8979.64\,\mathrm{MHz}$ and cooled to 15 mK. 
Its dispersive coupling to the atom results in a conditional shift of its resonance frequency by $\chi_\mathrm{B}/2\pi = -5.08 \pm 0.2\,\mathrm{MHz}$ ($\chi_\mathrm{D}/2\pi = -0.33 \pm 0.08\,\mathrm{MHz}$) when the atom is in $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ ($\ket{\mathrm{D}}$), see Fig.~1c. 
The engineered large asymmetry between $\chi_\mathrm{B}$ and $\chi_\mathrm{D}$ together with the cavity coupling rate to the output waveguide, $\kappa/2\pi = 3.62 \pm 0.05\,\mathrm{MHz}$, renders the cavity response markedly resolving for $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ vs.~not-$\ket{\mathrm{B}}$, yet non-resolving\cite{Riste2013}  for $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ vs.~$\ket{\mathrm{D}}$, thus preventing information about the dark transition from reaching the environment.   When probing the cavity response at $\omega_\mathrm{C} - \chi_\mathrm{B}$, the cavity  either remains empty, when the atom is in $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ or $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$, or fills with $\bar{n}=5 \pm 0.2$ photons  when the atom is in $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$.
This readout scheme yields a transduction of the $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$-occupancy signal with five-fold amplification, which is an important advantage to overcome the noise of the following amplification stages. To summarize, in this readout scheme, the  cavity probe inquires: Is the atom in $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ or not? The time needed to arrive at an answer with a confidence level of 68\% (signal-to-noise ratio of 1) is $\Gamma^{-1} \approx 1/\left(\kappa \bar{n}\right) = 8.8~\mathrm{ns}$ for an ideal amplifier chain (Supplement Sec.~IIIC).

Importantly, the engineered near-zero coupling between the cavity and the $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ state protects the $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ state from harmful effects, including Purcell relaxation, photon shot-noise dephasing, and the yet essentially unexplained residual measurement-induced relaxation in superconducting qubits (Supplement Sec.~I).We have measured the following coherence times for the $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ state: energy relaxation $T_1^\mathrm{D} = 116 \pm 5~\mathrm{\mu s}$, Ramsey coherence $T_{\mathrm{2R}}^\mathrm{D} = 120 \pm 5~\mathrm{\mu s}$, and Hahn echo $T_\mathrm{2E}^\mathrm{D} = 162 \pm 6~\mathrm{\mu s}$. 
While protected, the $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ state is indirectly quantum-non-demolition (QND) read out by the combination of the V-structure, the drive between $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ and $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$, and the fast $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$-state monitoring. In practice, we can access the population of $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ using an 80\,ns unitary rotation followed by a projective measurement of $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ (Methods). 
 
Once the state of the readout cavity is imprinted with information about the occupation of $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$, photons leak through the cavity output port into a superconducting waveguide, which is connected to the amplification chain, see Fig.~1b, where they are amplified by a factor of $10^{12}$. 
The first stage of amplification is a quantum-limited Josephson parametric converter (JPC), which is followed by a high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier at 4 K.
The overall efficiency of the amplification chain is $\eta = 0.33 \pm 0.03$, which includes all possible loss of information, such as due to photon loss, thermal photons, jitter, etc. (see Methods). At room temperature, the heterodyne signal is demodulated by a home-built field-programmable gate array (FPGA) controller, with a 4\,ns clock period for logic operations. 
The measurement record  consists of a time series of two quadrature outcomes, $I_\mathrm{rec}$ and $Q_\mathrm{rec}$,  every 260 ns,
which is the integration time $T_\mathrm{int}$,
from which the FPGA controller estimates the state of the atom in real time.
To reduce the influence of noise, the controller applies a real-time, hysteretic IQ filter (see Methods), and then, from the estimated atom state,  the control drives of the atom and readout cavity are actuated, realizing feedback control.




 

Having described  the setup of the experiment, we proceed to report its  results. 
The field reflected out of the cavity is monitored in a free-running protocol, for which the atom is subject to the continuous Rabi drives $\Omega_\mathrm{BG}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{DG}$, as depicted in Fig.~1.
Figure~2a shows a typical trace of the measurement record, displaying the quantum jumps of our three-level artificial atom. 
For most of the displayed duration of the record, $I_\mathrm{rec}$  switches rapidly between a low and high value, corresponding to approximately 0 ($\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ or $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$) and 5 ($\ket{\mathrm{B}}$) photons in the cavity, respectively. Spikes in $Q_\mathrm{rec}$, such as the one at $t=210\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ are recognized by the FPGA logic as a short-lived excursion of the atom to a higher excited state (Methods).
The corresponding  state of the atom, estimated by the FPGA controller, is depicted by the  color of the dots.
A change from $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$  to not-$\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ is equivalent to a ``click'' event, in that it corresponds to the emission of a photon from $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ to $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$, whose occurrence time is shown by the vertical  arrows in the inferred record $\mathrm dN\left(t\right)$ (top). 
We could also indicate upward transitions from $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ to $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$, corresponding to photon absorption events (not emphasized here), which would not be detectable in the atomic case.

In the example record, the detection of clicks stops completely at  $t=45\,\mathrm{\mu s}$, which reveals a quantum jump from $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$  to $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$, see Methods for operational definition of quantum jumps. 
The state $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ survives for $90\, \mathrm{\mu s}$ before the atom returns to $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ at $t =  135\, \mathrm{\mu s}$, when  the rapid switching between $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ and $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$  resumes until a second quantum jump to the dark state occurs at $t = 350\, \mathrm{\mu s}$.
Thus, the record presents jumps from $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ to $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ in the form of click interruptions. These ``outer'' jumps occur on a much longer time scale than the ``inner'' jumps from $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ to $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$.

In Fig.~2b, which is based on the continuous tracking of the quantum jumps for 3.2\,s, a histogram of the time spent in not-$\ket{\mathrm{B}}$, $\tau_{\operatorname{not-B}}$, is shown (See Extended Data Fig.~\ref{fig:B-wait-time} for the time spent in $\B$). 
The panel further shows a fit of the histogram by a bi-exponential curve that models two interleaved Poisson processes. 
This yields the average time the atom rests in $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ before an excitation to $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{BG}}^{-1} = 0.99\pm0.06\, \mathrm{\mu s}$, and the average time the atom stays up in $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ before returning to $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ and being detected, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{GD}}^{-1} = 30.8\pm0.4\, \mathrm{\mu s}$.
The average time between two consecutive $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ to $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ jumps  is $\Gamma_{\mathrm{DG}}^{-1} = 220\pm 5\, \mathrm{\mu s}$. The corresponding rates depend on the atom drive amplitudes ($\Omega_\mathrm{DG}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{BG}$) and the measurement rate $\Gamma$ (Supplement Sec.~II).
Crucially, all the rates in the system must be distributed over a minimum of 5 orders of magnitude, as shown in Fig.~1d.

\end{figure}

Having observed the quantum jumps in the free-running protocol, we  proceed to conditionally actuate the system control tones in order to tomographically reconstruct the time dynamics of the quantum jump from $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ to $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$, see Fig.~3a.
Like previously, after initiating the atom in $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$, the FPGA controller continuously subjects the system to the atom drives ($\Omega_\mathrm{BG}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{DG}$) and to the readout tone ($\mathrm R$).
However, in the event that the controller detects a single click followed by the complete absence of clicks for a total time $\Delta t_{\operatorname{catch}}$, the controller suspends all system drives, thus freezing the system evolution, and performs tomography, as explained in Methods. 
Note that in each realization, the tomography measurement yields a single +1 or -1 outcome, one bit of information for a single density matrix component. 
We also introduce a division of the duration $\Delta t_{\operatorname{catch}}$ into two phases, one lasting $\Delta t_\mathrm{on}$ during which $\Omega_\mathrm{DG}$ is left on and one lasting $\Delta t_\mathrm{off} = \Delta t_{\operatorname{catch}}- \Delta t_\mathrm{on}$ during which $\Omega_\mathrm{DG}$ is turned off. 
As we explain below, this has the purpose of demonstrating that the evolution of the jump is not simply due to the Rabi drive between $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ and $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$.  



In Fig.~3b, we show the dynamics of the jump mapped out in the full presence of the Rabi drive, $\Omega_\mathrm{GD}$, by setting $\Delta t_\mathrm{off}=0$. 
From $3.4\times10^{6}$ experimental realizations we reconstruct, as a function of $\Delta t_{\operatorname{catch}}$,  the quantum state, and present the evolution of the jump from $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ to $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ as the normalized, conditional GD tomogram (Methods).
For $\Delta t_{\operatorname{catch}} < 2\, \mathrm{\mu s}$, the atom is  predominantly detected in $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ ($Z_\mathrm{GD} = -1$),  whereas for $\Delta t_{\operatorname{catch}}  > 10\, \mathrm{\mu s}$, it is predominantly detected in $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$  ($Z_\mathrm{GD} = +1$). 
Imperfections, mostly excitations to higher levels, reduce the maximum observed value to $Z_\mathrm{GD} = +0.9$ (Supplement Sec.~IIIB2). 
For intermediate no-click times, between $ \Delta  t_{\operatorname{catch}} =2 \, \mathrm{\mu s}$ and $\Delta t_{\operatorname{catch}} = 10\, \mathrm{\mu s}$, the state of the atom evolves  continuously and coherently from $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ to $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ ---  the  flight of the quantum jump. 
The time of mid flight,  $\Delta t_\mathrm{mid} \equiv 3.95\, \mathrm{\mu s}$, is markedly shorter than the Rabi period $2\pi/\Omega_\mathrm{DG} = 50\,  \mathrm{\mu s}$, and is given by the  function $ 
\Delta t_{\text{mid}}=\left(\frac{\Omega_\mathrm{BG}^{2}}{2\Gamma}\right)^{-1}\ln\left(\frac{\Omega_\mathrm{BG}^{2}}{\Omega_\mathrm{DG} \Gamma}+1\right)
$, in which $\Omega_\mathrm{DG}$ enters logarithmically (Supplement Sec.~IIA). 
The maximum coherence of the superposition, corresponding to $\sqrt{X_\mathrm{GD}^2 + Y_\mathrm{GD}^2}$, during the flight is $0.71 \pm 0.005$, see also Extended Data Fig.~\ref{fig:tomo_tmid}, quantitatively understood to be limited by several small imperfections (Supplement Sec.~IIIB2). 

Motivated by the quantum trajectory analysis, we fit the experimental data with
 $\mathrm{Z}_\text{GD}(\Delta t_{\operatorname{catch}} ) = a +b \tanh( \Delta t_{\operatorname{catch}}/\tau + c) $, 
$\mathrm{X}_\text{GD}(\Delta t_{\operatorname{catch}} ) = a' +b' \operatorname{sech}(\Delta t_{\operatorname{catch}}/\tau' + c') $, and $\mathrm{Y}_\text{GD}(\Delta t_{\operatorname{catch}} ) =  0$. 
We compare the fitted jump parameters ($a,a',b,b',c,c',\tau,\tau'$) to those 
calculated from the theory and numerical simulations using independently measured system characteristics, and find agreement at the percent level (Supplement Sec.~IIIA). 

By repeating the experiment with $\Delta t_\text{on} = 2\, \mathrm{\mu s}$, in Fig.~3c, we show that the jump proceeds even if the GD drive is shut off at the beginning of the no-click period.
The jump remains coherent and only differs from the previous case in a minor renormalization of the overall amplitude and timescale.
The mid-flight time of the jump, $\Delta t_\mathrm{mid}'$, is given by a modified formula (Supplement Sec.~IIA3). 
The results demonstrate that the role of  the Rabi drive $\Omega_\mathrm{DG}$ is to initiate the jump and provide a reference for the phase of its evolution\footnote{
A similar phase reference for a non-unitary, yet deterministic,  evolution induced by measurement was previously found in a different context in: N. Katz, M. Ansmann, R. C. Bialczak, E. Lucero, R. McDermott, M. Neeley, M. Steffen, E. M. Weig, A. N. Cleland, J. M. Martinis, and A. N. Korotkov, Science (New York, N.Y.) 312, 1498 (2006).
}. 
Note that the $\Delta t_\mathrm{catch} \gg \Delta t_\mathrm{mid}$ non-zero steady state value of $X_\mathrm{GD}$ in Fig.~3b is the result of the competition between the Rabi drive $\Omega_\mathrm{DG}$ and the effect of the measurement of $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ (Supplement Sec.~IIA2).
This is confirmed in Fig.~3c, where $\Omega_\mathrm{DG} = 0$, and where there is no offset in the steady state value.  

The results of Fig.~\ref{fig:catch} demonstrate that despite the unpredictability  of the jumps from $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ to $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$, they are preceded by an identical no-click record. While the jump starts at a random time and can be prematurely interrupted by a click, the deterministic nature of the uninterrupted flight comes as a surprise given the quantum fluctuations in the heterodyne record $I_\mathrm{rec}$ during the jump --- an island of predictability in a sea of uncertainty.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:reverse}b,  we show that by choosing $\Delta t_{\operatorname{catch}} = \Delta  t_\mathrm{mid}$ for the no-click period to serve as an advance warning signal, we reverse the quantum jump\footnote{
Reversal of quantum jumps have been theoretically considered in a different context, see H. Mabuchi and P. Zoller, Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 3108 (1996).}
in the presence of  $\Omega_\mathrm{DG}$, confirming its coherence; the same result is found when $\Omega_\mathrm{DG}$ is off,  see Extended Data Fig.~4.
The reverse pulse characteristics are defined in Fig.~\ref{fig:reverse}a. 
For $\varphi_\mathrm{I} = \pi/2$, our feedback protocol succeeds in reversing the jump to $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ with  $83.1\%\pm0.3\%$ fidelity, while for $\varphi_\mathrm{I} = 3\pi/2$, the protocol completes the jump to $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$, with  $82.0\%\pm0.3\%$ fidelity. 
In a control experiment, we repeat the protocol by applying the reverse pulse at random times, rather than those determined by the advance warning signal. 
Without the advance warning signal, the measured populations only reflect those of the ensemble average.




In a final experiment, we programmed the controller with the optimal reverse pulse parameters $\left\{\theta_{I}\left(\Delta  t_{\mathrm{catch}}\right),\varphi_{I}\left(\Delta  t_{\mathrm{catch}}\right)\right\}$, and as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:reverse}c, we measured the success of the reverse protocol as a function of the catch time, $\Delta t_\mathrm{catch}$.
The closed/open dots indicate the results for $\Omega_\mathrm{DG}$ on/off, while the  solid curves are theory fits motivated by the exact analytic expressions (Supplement Sec.~IIIA).
The complementary red dots and curves reproduce the open-loop results of Fig.~\ref{fig:catch} for comparison. 











From the experimental results of Fig.~2a one can infer, consistent with Bohr's initial intuition and the original ion experiments, that quantum jumps are random and discrete. 
Yet, the results of Fig.~3 support a contrary view, consistent with that of Schrödinger: the evolution of the jump is coherent and continuous. 
Noting the difference in time scales in the two figures, we interpret the coexistence of these seemingly opposed point of views as a unification of the discreteness of countable events like jumps  with the continuity of the deterministic Schrödinger’s equation.
Furthermore, although all $6.8\times10^6$ recorded jumps (Fig.~3) are entirely independent of one another and stochastic in their initiation and termination, the tomographic measurements as a function of $\Delta t_\mathrm{catch}$ explicitly show that all jump evolutions follow an essentially identical, predetermined path in Hilbert space — not a randomly chosen one — and, in this sense, they are deterministic.  These results are further corroborated by  the reversal experiments shown in Fig.~4,  which exploit the continuous, coherent, and deterministic nature of the jump evolution and critically hinge on priori knowledge of the Hilbert space path. 
With this knowledge ignored in the control experiment of Fig. 4b,  failure of the reversal is observed. 

In conclusion, these experiments revealing the coherence of the jump, promote the view that a single quantum system under efficient, continuous observation is characterized by a time-dependent state vector inferred from the record of previous measurement outcomes, and whose meaning is that of an objective, generalized degree of freedom.
The knowledge of the system on short timescales is not incompatible with an unpredictable switching behavior on long time scales. 
The excellent agreement between experiment and theory including known experimental imperfections  (Supplement Sec.~IIIA) thus provides support to the modern quantum trajectory theory and its reliability for predicting the performance of real-time intervention techniques in the control of single quantum systems.

\textbf{Monitoring quantum jumps}
\label{sec:What_Are_Quantum_Jumps}


Here, we aim to briefly explain  how  the GD dynamics is monitored and when do we conclude that a quantum jump has occurred.


\textit{Monitoring the GD manifold through B de-excitations.}
The state of the atom within the GD manifold is monitored indirectly, by measuring the rate of de-excitations from the ancillary state $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$, while the G to B excitation tone $\Omega_\mathrm{BG}$ is applied.
As explained below, the monitoring scheme is such that when the atom is in the dark state, $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$, the rate of de-excitations from $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ to $\ket{\mathrm{G}} $ is zero.
Conversely, when the atom is in  $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$, the rate  is non-zero.
Henceforth, we will  refer to a de-excitation from $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ to $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$  simply as a de-excitation.
In summary,  when the rate of de-excitations for a measurement segment is zero, $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ is assigned to it; otherwise, $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ or $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ is assigned (see IQ filter section of Methods).
The rate can be monitored by either a direct or indirect method, as explained further below.  

\textit{Quantum jumps.} 
Sections of the (continuous) measurement record are converted into state assignments, as discussed above, such as B, G, or D.
In the experiment, long sequences of such measurements yield the same result, i.e., GGG\ldots or DDD\ldots 
When the string of results suddenly switches its value, we say that a quantum jump has occurred.\citeMethods{Cook1988}

\textit{Source of the difference for the de-excitation rates.}
The rate of de-excitations is zero when the atom is in $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ because the V-shape level structure forbids any direct DB transitions; hence,  $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ cannot be excited from $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$. 
Conversely, when the atom is in $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$, the Rabi drive $\Omega_\mathrm{BG}$ can excite the atom to $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$. Since this ancillary state is effectively short-lived, it almost immediately de-excites back to $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$. 
Note that in this explanation we neglect parasitic transitions to higher excited states, which are considered in the Supplement. 


\textit{De-excitation detection: direct or indirect.}
A de-excitation can be detected by a direct or, alternatively, indirect method. 
For atomic experiments, direct detection is a natural choice. 
The photon emitted by the atom during the de-excitation, carrying away the energy once stored in $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$,  is collected and destructively absorbed in the sensor of a photodetecting measurement apparatus, which produces a ``click'' signal (in practice, a current or voltage pulse).
Unfortunately, unavoidable imperfections and detector non-idealities  prohibit this method for the continuous detection of nearly every single de-excitation (Supplement Sec.~III).
Alternatively, one can use an indirect monitoring method.
In our experiment, instead of detecting the emitted photon, we  detect the  de-excitation by monitoring the $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ population through an ancillary degree of freedom, the readout cavity, coupled to the atom. 

\textit{Indirect (dispersive) detection.}
The readout cavity frequency depends on the state of the atom. 
When the atom is in $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$, the readout cavity frequency shifts down by more than a cavity linewidth. 
The cavity frequency, and hence the $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ population of the atom, is probed by a continuous readout tone applied at the $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$-cavity frequency. 
When the atom is in $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$, the probe tone is resonant and fills the cavity with a large number of photons, $\bar{n}$. Otherwise, when the atom is \textit{not}-in-$\ket{\mathrm{B}}$, the probe tone is far off resonant and the cavity is empty of photons. 
Choosing $\bar{n}\gg1$ makes a change in the $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ occupancy conspicuous, and hence a de-excitation, $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ to not-$\ket{\mathrm{B}}$, is readily observed, even in the presence of measurement inefficiencies and imperfections.
As explained in Sec.~IIIC of the Supplement, this indirect dispersive method in effect increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and de-excitation detection efficiency. 
Another notable difference between the direct and indirect method is that in the indirect method the atom fully but shortly occupies  $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$  before de-exciting to  $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$, while in the direct scheme the  probability amplitude to be in $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$  is never appreciable before a de-excitation, see Sec.~II of the Supplementary Information.
In other words, in the direct monitoring scheme, there are explicitly two sets of quantum jumps: the BG and DG ones. The BG ones occurs much faster and are nested within the DG jumps. The fast dynamics of these ``inner'' jumps is used to interrogate the dynamics of ``outer,'' DG jumps. 





































\textbf{Setup of the Experiment}

\textit{Setup and signals.} Our experiments were carried out in a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator (\textit{Oxford Triton 200}). The cavity and JPC\citeMethods{Bergeal2010} were shielded from stray magnetic fields by a cryogenic $\mu$-metal (\textit{Amumetal A4K}) shield. Our input-output cryogenic setup is nearly identical to that described in Ref.~\onlinecite{Ofek2016}, aside from the differences evident in the schematic of our setup (see Fig.~1b and Methods) or described in the following.

The control tones depicted in Fig.~1 were each generated from  individual microwave generators ($\Omega_\mathrm{DG}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{B0}$: \textit{Agilent N5183A}; readout cavity tone R and $\Omega_\mathrm{B1}$: \textit{Vaunix LabBrick LMS-103-13} and LMS-802-13, respectively). To achieve IQ control, the generated tones were mixed (\textit{Marki Microwave Mixers IQ-0618LXP} for the cavity and \textit{IQ-0307LXP} for $\Omega_\mathrm{B0}, \Omega_\mathrm{B1}$, and $\Omega_\mathrm{DG}$) with intermediate-frequency (IF) signals synthesized by the 16 bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs) of the integrated FPGA controller system (\textit{Innovative Integration VPXI-ePC}). Prior to mixing, each analog output was filtered by a $50\,\Omega$ low pass filter (\textit{Mini-Circuits BLP-300+}) and attenuated by a minimum of 10\,dB.
The radio-frequency (RF) output was amplified at room temperature (\textit{MiniCircuits ZVA-183-S+}) and filtered by \textit{Mini-Circuits} coaxial bandpass filters.
The output signal was further pulse modulated by the FPGA with high isolation SPST switches (\textit{Analog Device HMC-C019}), which provided additional 80\,dB isolation when the control drives were turned off.
The signals were subsequently routed to the input lines of the refrigerator, whose details were described in Refs.~\onlinecite{Ofek2016} and~\onlineciteMethods{Minev2016}.

At room temperature, following the cryogenic high-electron mobility amplifier (HEMT;  \textit{Low Noise Factory LNF-LNC7\_10A}), the signal were amplified by 28\,dB (\textit{Miteq AFS3-00101200-35-ULN}) before being mixed down (\textit{Marki image reject double-balanced mixer IRW-0618}) to an intermediate frequency (IF) of 50\,MHz, where they were band-pass filtered (\textit{Mini-Circuits SIF-50+}) and further amplified by a cascaded preamplifier (\textit{Stanford Research Systems SR445A}), before finally digitization by the FPGA analog-to-digital converters (ADC).




\textbf{Atom-cavity implementation}

The superconducting artificial atom consisted of two coupled transmon qubits fabricated on a 2.9~mm-by-7~mm double-side-polished  c-plane sapphire wafer with the Al/Al$\text{O}_\text{x}$/Al bridge-free electron-beam lithography technique\citeMethods{Lecocq2011-bridge-free, Rigetti2009}. 
The first transmon (B) was aligned with the electric field of the fundamental $\mathrm{TE}_\mathrm{101}$ mode of an aluminum rectangular cavity (alloy 6061; dimensions: 5.08~mm by 35.5~mm by 17.8~mm), while the second transmon (D) was oriented perpendicular to the first and  positioned $170\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ adjacent to it.
The inductance of the Josephson junction of each transmon (9~nH for both B and D), the placement and dimensions of each transmon, and the geometry of the cavity were designed and optimized using finite-element electromagnetic analysis and the energy-participation-ratio (EPR) method\citeMethods{Minev2018-EPR}. The analysis also verified that the coupling  between the two qubits is described by the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_\mathrm{int} = -\chi_\mathrm{DB} \hat{n}_\mathrm{B} \otimes  \hat{n}_\mathrm{D}$, where $\hat{n}_\mathrm{B/D}$ is the photon number operator of the B/D qubit, and  $\chi_\mathrm{DB}$ is the cross-Kerr frequency. 

The measured frequency and anharmonicity of the D qubit were $\omega_\mathrm{D}/2\pi = 4845.255\,\mathrm{MHz}$ and  $\alpha_\mathrm{DG}/2\pi = 152\,\mathrm{MHz}  $, respectively, while those of the B qubit were $\omega_\mathrm{B}/2\pi = 5570.349 \,\mathrm{MHz}$ and $\alpha_\mathrm{BG}/2\pi = 195 \,\mathrm{MHz}$, respectively. 
The cross-Kerr coupling was $\chi_\mathrm{DB} /2\pi = 61\,\mathrm{MHz}$.
The relaxation time of  $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$  was $T_\mathrm{1}^{\mathrm{B}} =28 \pm 2\, \mathrm{\mu s}$, limited by the Purcell effect by design, while its Ramsey coherence time was  $T_\mathrm{2R}^\mathrm{B} =  18\pm1\, \mathrm{\mu s}$.
The remaining parameters of the system are provided in the main text. 


\textbf{Atom and cavity drives} 

In all experiments, the following drive parameters were used: 
The DG Rabi drive, $\Omega_\mathrm{DG}$, was applied 275\,kHz below $\omega_\mathrm{D}$, to account for the Stark shift of the cavity. 
The BG drive, $\Omega_\mathrm{BG}$, was realized as a bi-chromatic tone in order to unselectively address the BG transition, which was broadened and Stark shifted due to the coupling between $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ and the readout cavity. 
Specifically, we address transitions from $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ to $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ with a Rabi drive $\Omega_\mathrm{B0}/2\pi = 1.20\pm0.01\,$MHz at frequency $\omega_\mathrm{BG}$, whereas transitions from $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ to $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ are addressed with a Rabi drive $\Omega_\mathrm{B1}/2\pi = 0.60\pm0.01\,$MHz tuned 30\,MHz below $\omega_\mathrm{BG}$. This bi-chromatic scheme provided the ability to tune the up-click and down-click rates independently, but otherwise essentially functioned as an incoherent broad-band source. 

\textbf{IQ filter} 

To mitigate the effects of imperfections in the atom readout scheme in extracting a $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$/not-$\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ result, we applied a two-point, hysteretic IQ filter, implemented on the FPGA controller in real time. 
The filter is realized by comparing the present quadrature record values $ \left\{ I_\mathrm{rec}, Q_\mathrm{rec}\right\} $, with three thresholds ($I_\mathrm{B}, I_{\bar{\mathrm{B}}},$ and $Q_\mathrm{B}$) as summarized in Extended Data Table~\ref{table:iq-filter-logic}.
	
The filter and thresholds were selected to provide a best estimate of the time of a click, operationally understood as a change in the filter output from $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ to not-$\ket{\mathrm{B}}$.
The $I_{{\mathrm{B}}}$ and  $I_{\bar{\mathrm{B}}}$ thresholds were chosen 1.5 standard deviations away from the I-quadrature mean of the $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ and not-$\ket{\mathrm{B}}$  distributions, respectively.
The  $Q_{{\mathrm{B}}}$ threshold was chosen 3 standard deviations away from the Q-quadrature mean. Higher excited states of the atom were selected out by $Q_\mathrm{rec} $ values exceeding the $Q_\mathrm{B}$ threshold. 





\textbf{Tomography} 

At the end of each experimental realization, we performed one of 15 rotation sequences on the atom that transferred information about one component of the density matrix, $\hat{\rho}_a$, to the population of $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$, which was measured with a 600\,ns square pulse on the readout cavity.
Pulses were calibrated with a combination of Rabi, derivative removal via adiabatic gate (DRAG)\citeMethods{JChow2010-DRAG}, All-XY\citeMethods{Reed2013}, and amplitude pulse train sequences\citeMethods{Bylander2011}. 
The readout signal was demodulated with the appropriate digital filter function required to realize temporal mode matching\citeMethods{Eichler2012-itinerant-entanglement}.
To remove the effect of potential systematic offset errors in the readout signal, we subtracted the measurement results of operator components of  $\hat{\rho}_a$ and their opposites.
From the measurement results of this protocol, we reconstructed the density matrix $\hat{\rho}_a$, and subsequently parametrized it in the useful form
$$\hat{\rho}_a = \begin{pmatrix}\frac{N}{2}\left(1-Z_{\mathrm{GD}}\right) & \frac{N}{2}\left(X_{\mathrm{GD}}+i Y_{\mathrm{GD}}\right) & R_{\mathrm{BG}}+i I_{\mathrm{BG}}\\
\frac{N}{2}\left(X_{\mathrm{ GD}}-i Y_{\mathrm{GD}}\right) & \frac{N}{2}\left(1+Z_{\mathrm{GD}}\right) & R_{\mathrm{BD}}+i I_{\mathrm{BD}}\\
R_{\mathrm{BG}}-i I_{\mathrm{BG}} & R_{\mathrm{BD}}-i I_{\mathrm{BD}} & 1-N
\end{pmatrix}, 
$$ where $X_\mathrm{GD}, Y_\mathrm{GD},$ and $Z_\mathrm{GD}$ are the Bloch vector components of the GD manifold, $N$ is the total population of  the $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ and $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ states, while $R_{\mathrm{BG}},  R_{\mathrm{BD}}, I_{\mathrm{BG}}$ and $I_{\mathrm{BD}}$ are the coherences associated with $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$, relative to the GD manifold. 
The measured population in $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$, $1-N$, remains below 0.03 during the quantum jump, see Extended Data Fig.~\ref{fig:reverseDGoff}.
Tomographic reconstruction was calibrated and verified by preparing Clifford states, accounting for the readout fidelity of 97\%.



\textbf{Control flow of the experiment}
 
\label{sec:experiment-flow}
A diagrammatic representation of the control flow of the experiment is illustrated in Extended Data Figure~\ref{fig:experiment-flow}a, whose elements are briefly described in the following.
``Start'': FPGA controller resets its internal memory registers to zero\cite{Ofek2016}$^,$ \citeMethods{Liu2016Thesis}, including the no-click counter ``cnt,'' defined below. 
``Prepare~B'': controller deterministically prepares the atom in $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$, a maximally conservative initial state, with measurement-based feedback\citeMethods{Riste2012-qubit-measure-reset}.
``Initialize'':  controller turns on the atom ($\Omega_\mathrm{BG}$ and~$\Omega_\mathrm{DG}$) and cavity ($\mathrm{R}$) drives and begins demodulation.
``Monitor and catch~$\Delta t_\mathrm{on}$'': with all drives on ($\Omega_\mathrm{BG}, \Omega_\mathrm{DG}$, and $\mathrm{R}$), the controller actively monitors the cavity  output signal until it detects no-clicks for duration $\Delta t_\mathrm{on}$, as described in panel (b), whereafter the controller proceeds to ``monitor and catch $\Delta t_\mathrm{off}$''  in the case that $\Delta t_\mathrm{off}>0$; otherwise, for $\Delta t_\mathrm{off}=0$, the controller proceeds to ``tomography''  (``feedback pulse'') for the catch (reverse) protocol.
``Monitor and catch~$\Delta t_\mathrm{off}$'': with the Rabi drive $\Omega_\mathrm{DG}$ off, while keeping the drives~$\Omega_\mathrm{BG}$ and~R on, the controller continues to monitor the output signal. The controller exits the routine only in one of two events: i) if it detects a click, in which case it proceeds to the ``declare B'' step of the ``monitor and catch~$\Delta t _\mathrm{on}$'' routine, or ii) if no further clicks are detected for the entirety of the pre-defined duration $\Delta t_\mathrm{off}$, in which case the controller advances to  the ``tomography'' (``feedback pulse'')  routine, when programmed for the catch (reverse) protocol.
``Feedback~pulse'': with all continuous-wave drives turned off, the controller performs a pulse on the DG transition of the atom, defined by the two angles $\left\{\theta_{I}\left(\Delta t_{\mathrm{catch}}\right),\varphi_{I}\left(\Delta t_{\mathrm{catch}}\right)\right\}$.
``Tomography'':  controller performs  next-in-order tomography sequence (see Tomography section above) while the demodulator finishes processing the final data in its pipeline. 
``Advance~tomo.'': tomography sequence counter is incremented; after a $50~\mathrm{\mu s}$ delay, the next realization of the experiment is started.

The concurrent-programming control flow of the``monitor and catch $\Delta t _\mathrm{on}$'' block is illustrated in Extended Data Fig.~\ref{fig:experiment-flow}b; specifically, the master and demodulator modules of the controller and synchronous sharing of data between them is depicted.
The FPGA demodulator outputs a pair of 16 bit signed integers, $\left\{ I_\mathrm{rec}, Q_\mathrm{rec}  \right\}$, every $T_\mathrm{int} = 260$~ns, which is routed to the master module, as depicted by the large left-pointing arrow (top).
The master module implements the IQ filter (see IQ filter section above) and tracks the number of consecutive not-$\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ measurement results with the counter ``cnt.'' The counter thus keeps track of the no-click time elapsed since the last click, which is understood as a change in the measurement result from $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ to not-$\ket{\mathrm{B}}$.
When the counter reaches the critical value $N_\mathrm{on}$, corresponding to~$\Delta t_\mathrm{on}$, the master and demodulator modules synchronously exit the current routine, see the~T* branch of the ``declare not-B'' decision block.
Until this condition is fulfilled (F*), the two modules proceed within the current routine as depicted by the black flowlines.
To minimize latency and maximize computation throughput, the master and demodulator were designed to be independent sequential processes running concurrently on the FPGA controller,  communicating strictly through synchronous message passing, which imposed stringent synchronization and execution time constraints.
All master inter-module logic was constrained to run at a 260~ns cycle, the start of which necessarily was imposed to coincide with a ``receive \& stream record'' operation, here, denoted by the stopwatch. In other words, this imposed the algorithmic constraint that all flowchart paths staring at a stopwatch and ending in a stopwatch, itself or other, were constrained to a 260\,ns execution timing. A second key timing constraint was imposed by the time required to propagate signals between the different FPGA cards, which corresponded to a minimum branching-instruction duration of 76~ns.

The corresponding demodulation-module flowchart is identical to that shown of panel (b); hence, it is not shown.
This routine functions in following manner:
If a~$\ket{\mathrm{B}}$  outcome is detected, the controller jumps to the ``declare B'' block of the monitor \& catch $\Delta t_\mathrm{on}$ routine;
otherwise, when only not-$\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ outcomes are observed, and the counter reaches the critical value $N_\mathrm{off}$, corresponding to $\Delta t_\mathrm{catch} = \Delta t_\mathrm{on} + \Delta t_\mathrm{off}$, the controller exits the routine.

The plots show the real (a) and imaginary (b) parts of the conditional density matrix, $\rho_\mathrm{c}$, at the mid flight of the quantum jump ($\Delta t_\mathrm{catch} = \Delta t_\mathrm{mid}$), in the presence of the Rabi drive from $\ket{\mathrm{G}}$ to $\ket{\mathrm{D}}$ ($\Delta t_\mathrm{off} = 0$).
The population of the $\ket{\mathrm{B}}$ state is 0.023, and the magnitude of all imaginary components is less than 0.007.
