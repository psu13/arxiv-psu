In the muon plot the nonresonant signal candidates can be seen as a vertical band around the \Bp mass. The diagonal bands show contributions from the \BuJpsiK and \BuPsiK decays. The horizontal bands show combinatorial backgrounds formed with the \jpsi and \psitwos resonances. In the electron plot the distribution of all of these components is smeared by the bremsstrahlung and the bremsstrahlung recovery process.}\label{fig:2Dplot}

\subsection*{Branching fraction measurements}

The comparison of the \BuKmm branching fraction from Ref.~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2014-006} to the \BuKee branching fraction resulting from the measurement of \RK presented in this paper is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:BFs}. The uncertainty stemming from the branching fractions of the corresponding normalisation channels is folded into the total uncertainty of each measurement.

\subsection*{Fits to the {\boldmath{\BuPsiK}} resonant mode }

The fits to the resonant \BuPsiK decay mode in different data-taking periods and trigger categories are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:resPsi2Sfits_categories}. The strong correlation between the combinatorial background and the partially reconstructed decays from higher charmonium resonances causes the variation of the fitted mass shapes across data-taking periods and trigger categories. However, this has a negligible effect on the signal yield extraction as the sum of the two contributions is constant across data-taking periods and trigger categories.

\subsection*{Overview of {\boldmath \RK} measurements}

An overview of available measurements of \RK in different \qsq regions is given in Fig~\ref{fig:RKresultVSq2}. Previous LHCb measurements are also included for comparison in Fig~\ref{fig:RKresultVSq2Old} and Fig~\ref{fig:RKresultOld}.
