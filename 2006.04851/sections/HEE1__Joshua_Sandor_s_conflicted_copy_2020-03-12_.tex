In this section, we shall look for `quantum extremal islands' using the holographic setup described in the previous sections. Of course, quantum extremal islands have recently proven especially enlightening in the context of the black hole information paradox in two-dimensional JT gravity, where the emergence of these islands has signalled a transition to a phase where entropy of the Hawking radiation decreases over time, \eg \cite{Almheiri:2019psf, Almheiri:2019hni, Almheiri:2019yqk, Chen:2019uhq, Penington:2019kki, Almheiri:2019qdq, Chen:2019iro}. Some preliminary investigations of quantum extremal islands in higher dimensions also appear in \cite{Penington:2019npb,Almheiri:2019psy}. In a companion paper \cite{QEI}, we will use the holographic model developed here to further extend these discussions to consider the black holes in arbitrary dimensions. However, our present discussion departs somewhat from this line of investigation because black holes are not involved. Rather, we are simply considering the holographic entanglement entropies for certain regions in the vacuum of the boundary CFT coupled to the conformal defect. In certain situations, we find that the corresponding RT surfaces cross the brane in the bulk and this can be interpreted in terms of the appearance of a quantum extremal island in the effective theory of gravity on the brane.

To expand on this last comment, let us consider a specific calculation of the entanglement entropy (EE): We consider the vacuum state of our boundary CFT on $\Rbb(\text{time})\times S^{d-1}(\text{space})$ with a conformal defect running along the equator of the $S^{d-1}$. As described in section \ref{sec:branegravity}, the bulk spacetime has locally an AdS$_{d+1}$ geometry and is bisected by a brane extending out to the defect position on the asymptotic boundary. Now we wish to evaluate the EE in the boundary CFT for a region $\xR$ comprised of the union of two polar spherical caps on the $S^{d-1}$ -- see figure \ref{EEprob}.

We follow the usual holographic prescription to compute the EE. That is, we examine the bulk surfaces $\xV$ which are homologous to  $\xR$ and extremize the generalized entropy functional
\beq
 S_\EE(\xR) = {\rm min}\left\{\extr\,
 S_\gen(\xV)\right\}={\rm min}\left\{\extr
  \(
  \frac{A(\xV)}{4 G_\bulk} + \frac{A(\xV \cap {\rm brane})}{4 G_\brane}\)\right\}\,.
 \label{eq:sad}
\eeq
Of course, the first term above corresponds to the usual Ryu-Takayanagi (RT)  term \cite{Ryu:2006bv,Ryu:2006ef} while  we argue in Appendix \ref{generalE}, that the second term will arise whenever the bulk surface crosses a DGP brane.\footnote{Implicitly, eq.~\eqref{eq:sad} assumes that the bulk and brane gravitational actions both correspond to the Einstein-Hilbert action (with a cosmological constant term), as in eqs.~\reef{act2} and \reef{newbran}.} Let us denote the extremal bulk surface as $\Sigma_\xR$, and the intersection with the brane $\sigma_\xR=\Sigma_\xR \cap {\rm brane}$. Importantly, if there are multiple extrema, the EE is given by chosing the extremal surface yielding the smallest value for $S_\gen(\Sigma_\xR)$, as indicated above.

For the calculation described above, the candidate RT surfaces are anchored at the AdS boundary to the entangling surface $\SCFT=\partial \xR = \partial \RTsurf$, \ie the boundaries of these surfaces are comprised of two $(d-2)$-spheres, which are the boundaries of the two polar caps. We will find that there are two topologically distinct candidates for $\RTsurf$ which extremize the generalized entropy in eq.~\reef{eq:sad}. The first consists of two disconnected disks on either side of the brane (in which case $\sigma_\xR=\{\varnothing\}$). The second candidate has a cylindrical geometry which pierces the brane. Hence it is only in this latter case that the second term contributes in eq.~\reef{eq:sad}. As noted above, the correct RT surface is chosen from these two candidates as the one which yields a smaller generalized entropy. Generally, we shall find that when the two polar caps are small, the disconnected discs are favoured, while the cylindrical surface can be the leading saddle for large polar caps are large. We will denote the first situation as the `disconnected' phase and the latter as the `connected' phase. As we will describe in section \ref{sec:examples}, the details of the transition between these two phases also depends on other parameters in the holographic model, \eg the tension and gravitational coupling of the brane.

To understand the interpretation of these results in terms of quantum extremal islands, we turn to the `brane perspective' described in the previous section. In this effective description, the entanglement entropy is given the `island rule' proposed in \cite{Almheiri:2019hni},
\beqa
 S_\EE(\xR) &=& {\rm min}\left\{\extr\,
 S_\gen(R\cup \text{islands} )\right\} \labell{rule1}\\
&=&{\rm min}\left\{\extr
  \(  S_\EE(\braneR \cup \text{islands}) + \frac{A\(\partial(\islands)\)}{4 G_\brane}\)\right\}\,.
 \nonumber
\eeqa
As geometries $\CFTR=\braneR$, but we have used a different font on the right-hand side to emphasize the fact that from the effective `boundary perspective' does not give the same detailed description of the CFT state on $\CFTR$, as the boundary or bulk perspectives.

Now it is straightforward to interprete the previous holographic discussion in terms of eq.~\reef{rule1}. In particular, in the disconnected phase, the EE only involves the modes enclosed within the two polar caps and there is no contribution from the CFT in the gravitational region, \ie on the AdS$_d$ brane. In passing, let us recall that the short wavelength modes in the vicinity of the entangling surface $\SCFT$ produce various UV divergent boundary contributions, such as the celebrated area law term \cite{Sorkin_1983,Bombelli:1986rw,Srednicki:1993im}. Of course, these contributions are regulated in the holographic calculation by introducing a cutoff surface near the asymptotic AdS boundary \cite{Rangamani:2016dms}.

However, in the connected phase, the holographic RT surface crosses the brane and we see an explicit brane contribution in eq.~\reef{eq:sad} (evaluated on $\sigma_\xR$). From the brane perspective, a quantum extremal island has formed in the gravitational region (\ie the region on the brane enclosed by $\sigma_\xR$)\footnote{Let us add that from the bulk perspective, entanglement wedge reconstruction \cite{EW1,EW2,EW3,Jafferis:2015del,Dong:2016eik,Faulkner:2017vdd,Cotler:2017erl} ensures that operators within this island can be reconstructed from boundary CFT data in $\xR$.} and the analogous gravitational term appears in the island rule \reef{rule1}. The bulk RT contribution in eq.~\reef{eq:sad} then corresponds to $S_\EE(\braneR \cup \text{islands})$ in eq.~\reef{rule1} -- just as it did in the disconnected phase. Comparing to the gravitational action \reef{act3} on the brane, one might expect that the gravitational term in eq.~\reef{rule1} would involve $1/G_\eff$ rather than $1/G_\brane$. However, from eq.~\reef{Newton33}, \rcm{and explained in previous section??} we can see that $1/G_\eff$ is comprised of two components: the bare contribution $1/G_\brane$, and the bulk contribution proportional to $L/G_\bulk$. From the brane perspective, we can regard the latter as being induced by integrating out the CFT degrees of freedom on the brane. We might further split the CFT entropy into UV-finite and UV-`divergent' contributions, where the latter are contributions proportional to inverse powers of $\s$. These are the analog of the UV divergent boundary contributions discussed above for the boundary CFT in the regions without gravity. As discussed in section \ref{face}, the brane position imposes  a UV cutoff for the CFT on the brane, and hence the corresponding `divergent' contributions to the EE are in fact finite and instead yield contributions which match those expected for the gravitational entropy from the induced contributions to eq.~\reef{act3}. This makes contact with the usual notion of generalized entropy as the sum of the geometric gravitational entropy and the entropy of the quantum fields \cite{Faulkner:2013ana,Engelhardt:2014gca}. We elaborate on this perspective in more detail in section \ref{sec:genera}. In section \ref{sec:enzyme}, we also discuss how varying the position of the $\sigma_\xR$ can be interpreted as finding the quantum extremal surface from the brane perspective.



%\rcm{****} The remainder of this section is organized as follows: In section \ref{sec:enzyme}, we introduce the bulk metrics and other technical details required for the holographic calculation of entanglement entropy. In section \ref{sec:genera}, we interpret the HRT calculation of entanglement entropy from the brane perspective. Finally, in section \ref{sec:examples}, we explicitly carry out the extremization of generalized entropy and evaluating the generalized entropy in the disconnected no-island and connected island phases. $d=3$

% In AdS/CFT, branes such as the ones describes above play an essential role in the description of Boundary CFT (BCFT). If the CFT itself is living on a manifold with a boundary, the holographic prescription states that the dual geometry consists also of a manifold with a boundary - an AdS-like spacetime that ends on a brane, which is itself anchored at the boundary of the CFT (an `end-of-the-world brane') \cite{ads/bcft}.
%
% In general, the holographic recipe shows that the entanglement entropy of a subregion $A$ of the field theory is given by an extremal surface $\sigma$ that is anchored at the asymptotic boundary at $A$, that extends into the bulk and remains homologous to $A$. In the case of a BCFT, the new ingredient is that the R-T surface $\sigma$ is also allowed to end up at the brane. This introduces a new set of interesting `candidate' surfaces that compete in the minimization process.
%
% Recently, a new formula for the computation of holographic entanglement entropy was proposed, relevant for situations when the quantum system of interest is in contact with another system that contains gravity as a dynamical field. We will investigate this formula using the same bulk setup as described in previous sections. \iar{explain some more}

\subsection{RT meets the Brane}
\label{sec:enzyme}
%
In this section, we shall introduce some technical details, which are useful to calculate the EE associated with the two polar caps in the boundary CFT. In particular, we examine the behaviour of the bulk RT surface $\Sigma_\xR$ as it crosses the brane, \ie how the intersection surface $\sigma_\xR$ is determined.
However, we begin by specifying our EE calculation more precisely and reviewing the metrics describing the bulk spacetime.

Let us describe the $\Rbb\times S^{d-1}$ geometry on which the boundary CFT lives with,
\beq\label{metricCFT}
ds^2=R^2\left[-dt^2+
d\theta^2+\sin^2\!\theta\,d\Omega_{d-2}^2 \right]\,,
\eeq
where $R$ is the radius of curvature of the $(d-1)$-sphere. The polar angle $\theta$ runs over $0\le\theta\le\pi$, and the conformal defect sits at the equator $\theta=\pi/2$. As illustrated in figure \ref{EEprob}, we wish to evaluate the EE in the boundary CFT for a region $\xR$ comprised of two polar caps on the $S^{d-1}$. More specifically, we choose the entangling surface $\SCFT$ to be two circles placed  symmetrically on either side of the defect at $\theta=\pi/2\pm\thb$. Hence we are evaluating the EE between these two balls and the complementary region, which corresponds to a `belt' of width $2\thb$ centered on the conformal defect.

Turning now to the bulk geometry, recall that in section \ref{BranGeo}, we discussed the background solution in terms a metric where the AdS$_{d+1}$ geometry was foliated by AdS$_d$ slices. Eq.~\reef{metric3} describes the local geometry on either side of the brane
located at $z=\s$ with
\beq\label{metric3a}
ds^2=\frac{L^2}{z^2}\left[dz^2 +  L^2\left(1 + \frac{z^2}{4\,L^2}\right)^2 \left(-\cosh^2\!\tdr\,dt^2+d\tdr^2+\sinh^2\!\tdr\,d\Omega_{d-2}^2 \right)\right]\,.
\eeq
While these coordinates are well suited to discuss the brane geometry, we also consider `global' coordinates for the AdS$_{d+1}$ geometry
\beq\label{metric2s}
ds^2=L^2\left[-\cosh^2\!r\,dt^2+dr^2+\sinh^2\!r\,\left(
d\theta^2+\sin^2\!\theta\,d\Omega_{d-2}^2\right) \right]\,,
\eeq
which are better adapted to discuss the boundary theory. That is, up to a Weyl rescaling, the geometry on fixed $r$ surfaces matches eq.~\reef{metricCFT}  in the asymptotic region, and the UV regulator surface needed to properly define the holographic EE can be simply chosen as some slice $r=r_\mt{UV}\gg L$.

However, while we refer to eq.~\reef{metric2s} as `global' coordinates, they do not cover the entire back-reacted bulk solution depicted in figure \ref{fig:brane2}. Rather we use the coordinates in eq.~\reef{metric2s} to cover two patches on either side of the brane and near the asymptotic AdS$_{d+1}$ boundary.\footnote{Of course, the same applies for the previous coordinates in eq.~\reef{metric3a}.} Comparing eqs.~\reef{metric3a} and \reef{metric2s}, it is straightforward to identify the transformation between the two coordinate systems as
\beq\label{transfor1}
\tanh\tdr=\tanh r\sin\theta\,,\quad \frac{z}L=-2\sinh r\,\cos\theta\pm2\sqrt{\sinh^2\! r\,\cos^2\!\theta+1}\,.
\eeq
With the + (--) sign, the brane at $z=z_\mt{B}\ll L$ resides near the boundary hemisphere with $0\le\theta\le\pi/2$ ($\pi/2\le\theta\le\pi$) and $r\to\infty$. Therefore letting $\theta$ run from 0 to $\pi$ on the boundary with the defect at $\theta=\pi/2$, we choose the -- (+) sign to cover the patch covering the asymptotic boundary hemisphere $0\le\theta\le\pi/2$ ($\pi/2\le\theta\le\pi$).

Recall that using the AdS foliation \reef{metric3a}, the position of the brane was specified by $z=\s$. In terms of the global coordinates \reef{metric2s} , the brane position can be specified with
\beq\label{eq:foobar}
\sinh^2\! r\, \cos^2\!\theta= \frac{L^2}{\s^2}\(1-\frac{\s^2}{4L^2}\)^2\,.
\eeq
Note that the specific sign of $\cos\theta$ depends on whether one considers the coordinate patch above or below the brane -- see comments below eq.~\reef{transfor1}. Further, we reach the asymptotic boundary on the brane by taking $\tdr\to\infty$, which in the global coordinates then corresponds to $r\to\infty$ and $\theta\to\pi/2$. Hence, we see that the brane intersects the asymptotic boundary at the position of the conformal defect, as expected.

To examine the behaviour of the bulk RT surface $\Sigma_\xR$ where it crosses the brane, it is useful  to consider the problem of extremal surfaces using eq.~\reef{metric3a}. Of course, because the bulk geometry is static, the RT surfaces will be confined to a constant time slice in the bulk. Further, the entangling surfaces in the boundary are spherically symmetric and so we only need to consider bulk surfaces with the same rotational symmetry on the $S^{d-2}$. That is, we parametrize the surfaces as $\tdr=\tdr(z)$ and the bulk contribution to the holographic EE is then given by
\beq\label{area0}
S_\mt{bulk}= 2\,\frac{L^{d-1}\, \Omega_{d-2}}{4\,\Gbk} \int \frac{dz}z \,\[\frac{L}{z}\left(1 + \frac{z^2}{4\,L^2}\right)\sinh\tdr\]^{d-2} \sqrt{1+L^2\left(1 + \frac{z^2}{4\,L^2}\right)^2\(\frac{d\tdr}{dz}\)^2}
\eeq
where $\Omega_{d-2}$ is the area of a unit $(d-2)$-sphere.\footnote{Recall that the area of a unit $n$-sphere is given by $\Omega_{n} = 2\pi^{\frac{n+1}2}/\Gamma\(\frac{n+1}2\)$. \label{footsphere}} An overall factor of 2 is included here because we assume that the profile $\tdr(z)$ will be reflection symmetric about the brane, and hence $S_\mt{RT}$ recieves the same contribution from both sides.

Now treating eq.~\reef{area0} as an action, we would derive an `Euler-Lagrange' equation for the profile whose solution corresponds to an extremal surface in the bulk, \ie away from the brane.\footnote{This equation is rather involved and the details are not important here.} However, this equation is second order and so the solutions are parameterized by two integration constants. One of these constants is fixed by the angle $\theta_\mt{CFT}$ on the asymptotic boundary (\ie the position of the entangling surface $\SCFT$ in the boundary theory), and the other, by the radius $\tdr_\mt{B}$ at which the RT surface intersects the brane, \ie $\tdr(z=\s)=\tdr_\mt{B}$. Hence we are left with the question of fixing the boundary condition at the brane.

In fact, there are two contributions that come into play at the brane. The first is the DGP contribution in eq.~\reef{eq:sad},
\beq\label{area1}
S_\mt{brane}= \frac{L^{d-2}\, \Omega_{d-2}}{4\,\Gbr} \,\[\frac{L}{\s}\left(1 + \frac{\s^2}{4\,L^2}\right)\sinh\tdr_\mt{B}\]^{d-2} \,.
\eeq
The second is a boundary term that comes from integrating by parts in the variation of the RT functional \reef{area0}. Combining these, one arrives at the following expression\footnote{Implicitly, we assume that we care considering the RT surfaces with a cylindrical topology, \ie in the connected phase. Examining these boundary terms carefully, one also finds that they are eliminated with $\tdr_\mt{B}=0$. This solution points towards the existence of the second phase of disconnected surfaces, which do not intersect the brane.}
\beq\label{ortho1}
L\,\frac{d\tdr}{dz}\bigg|_{z=\s}=\frac1{\Gbr}\,
\frac{\s/L}{1 + \frac{\s^2}{4\,L^2}}\[
\left(1 + \frac{\s^2}{4\,L^2}\right)^2\(\frac{2L}{\Gbk}\,\tanh\tdr_\mt{B}\)^2-\(\frac{\s/L}{\Gbr} \)^2\]^{-\frac12}\,.
\eeq
Hence scanning through the family of RT surfaces parametrized by $\tdr_\mt{B}$, the solution which satisfies the above boundary condition is the one that properly extremizes the full entropy functional in eq.~\reef{eq:sad}. \rcm{Add a picture to illustrate this discussion?? Could this be combined with a picture for the geometric discussion below??} One observation is that without the DGP term, \ie $1/\Gbr=0$, the boundary condition simplifies to $L\,{d\tdr}/{dz}|_{z=\s}=0$. That is, the RT surface intersects the brane at a right angle. Turning on the gravitational action on the brane (with a positive coupling) produces $L\,{d\tdr}/{dz}|_{z=\s}>0$, which arises from pushing $\tdr_\mt{B}$ to a smaller value. The decrease in $\tdr_\mt{B}$ is natural here because the DGP contribution in eq.~\reef{area1} adds an additional penalty for large areas on the brane and hence the effect is to shrink the area of $\sigma_\xR$.\footnote{Of course, if $1/\Gbr<0$ as we consider in section \ref{sec:examples}, then the DGP entropy \reef{area1} facilitates a larger area for $\sigma_\xR$ and so we find that $\tdr_\mt{B}$ increases.}

We observe that the above analysis has a simple interpretation in terms of the island rule \reef{rule1}. Recall that extremizing the RT functional \reef{area0} leads to a family of bulk solutions that are parametrized by $\tdr_\mt{B}$, their radius on the brane. Evaluating $S_\mt{bulk}+S_\mt{brane}$ for these different solutions is equivalent to evaluating the $S_\gen$ in eq.~\reef{rule1} with different candidates for the island geometry. The final step of extremizing with respect variations of $\tdr_\mt{B}$ then matches the extremization in the island rule and identifies the quantum extremal surface $\sigma_\xR$ on the brane.



To close the discussion here, we provide a more general geometric discussion of the boundary conditions.
The orthogonality between the RT suface and the RS brane is a special feature of the reflection symmetry of our setup. For a better geometric understanding of the boundary conditions, let us examine eq.~\reef{eq:sad} in more detail. Consider a $(d-1)$-dimensional surface $\xV$ parametrized by intrinsic coordinates $\xi^\alpha$, embedded in the $(d+1)$-dimensional bulk spacetime with coordinates $X^\mu$ and metric $g_{\mu\nu}$. Hence we describe the embedding of this surface in the bulk spacetime as $X^\mu = X^\mu(\xi^\alpha)$, and the induced metric then becomes
\beq
h_{\alpha\beta}= g_{\mu\nu}\,
  \frac{\partial X^\mu}{\partial \xi^\alpha}\,
  \frac{\partial X^\nu}{\partial \xi^\beta}\,.
\label{badnote}
\eeq
Hence the bulk contribution in eq.~\reef{eq:sad} becomes
\beq
  S_\mt{bulk}=\frac{A(\xV)}{4 G_\bulk}
  = \frac{1}{4G_\bulk}\int_\xV d^{d-1}\xi\; \sqrt{h}\,.
\label{eq:badNotation}
\eeq
Next to evaluate the brane contribution in eq.~\reef{eq:sad}, we introduce $(d-2)$ coordinates $y^a$ to parameterize the intersection of $\xV$ and the brane. The induced metric on this intersection surface then becomes
\beq\label{badnote2}
  \tilh_{ab}
  = h_{\alpha\beta}
  \frac{\partial \xi^\alpha}{\partial y^a}
  \frac{\partial \xi^\beta}{\partial y^b}\,,
\eeq
and the corresponding contribution to the generalized entropy is
\begin{align}
  S_\brane
  =& \frac{1}{4\Gbr}\int d^{d-2}y\; \sqrt{\tilh}\,.
  \label{eq:facundo}
\end{align}

Now following the prescription in eq.~\reef{eq:sad}, we wish to  extremize the sum of the two quantities above. So we begin with the variation of $S_\mt{bulk}$, which yields
\beq
\begin{split}
  \delta S_\mt{bulk}
  =& \frac{1}{4G_\bulk}\Bigg[ \int_{\xV\cap{\rm brane}}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! d^{d-2} y\,
  \sqrt{\tilh}\, g_{\mu\nu}\, (\partial_{n_\mt{R}} X^\mu+\partial_{n_\mt{L}}X^\mu) \,\delta X^\nu
  \\
  &+\int_\xV d^{d-1}\xi \sqrt{h}(\text{e.o.m.})_\nu \delta X^\nu
  \Bigg]\,.
\end{split}
  \label{eq:recipe}
\eeq
Here we assume that the equations of motion along the bulk of $\xV$ can be satisfied and so the second term above vanishes. However, one must integrate by parts to arrive at these equations and so we are left with a boundary term where $\xV$ crosses the brane.\footnote{Dirichlet boundary conditions remove the analogous boundary contributions at the asymptotic AdS boundary.} Here we are assuming that the extremal surface is not necessarily smooth at the brane and so $n_\mt{R}^\alpha$ and $n_\mt{L}^\alpha$ are unit normals to the intersection surface directed along the extremal surface approaching the brane from either side -- see figure \rcm{new fig}.

In fact, in the absence of the DGP term \reef{newbran}, there is no brane contribution \reef{eq:facundo} and then the vanishing of the boundary term in eq.~\reef{eq:recipe} dictates $n_\mt{R}^\alpha+n_\mt{L}^\alpha=0$. That is, with $1/\Gbr=0$, the boundary condition is that the RT surface should pass smoothly through the brane. In the reflection symmetric setup considered above, this can only be accomplished if the RT surface is orthogonal to the brane, \ie both $n_\mt{R}^\alpha$ and $n_\mt{L}^\alpha$ are orthogonal to the brane.

Of course, with a DGP brane, we must also consider the variation of $S_\brane$ in eq.~\reef{eq:facundo}, which yields
\begin{align}
  \delta S_\brane
  =& \frac{1}{4\Gbr}
  \int d^{d-2}y\; \sqrt{\tilh}\,
  \inducedK_i \,\frac{\partial x^i}{\partial X^\nu}\, \delta X^\nu,
  \label{eq:puerto}
\end{align}
where $\inducedK_i$ denotes the trace of the extrinsic curvatures of the intersection surface and the brane, as viewed from the brane geometry with $(d-1)$ coordinates $x^i$. (In deriving \eqref{eq:puerto}, we have interpretted $\inducedK_i$ as the expansion\footnote{Note that $\inducedK_i$ gives the expansion of the area element under the map produced by geodesics shot out normal to $\RT\cap\brane$. However, the images of $\RT\cap\brane$ under $\delta X^\nu$ and under the map obtained by projecting $\delta X^\nu$ perpendicular to $\RT\cap\brane$ differs only at second order in $\delta X^\nu$ (assuming $\delta X^\nu$ is smooth). \vc{I drew a picture to convince myself... does this seem right? (Even if it's not right, I think it suffices to restrict $\delta X^\nu|_{\RT\cap\brane}$ to be orthogonal to the intersection.)}} of the area element $\sqrt{\tilh}$.)
Requiring the sum of eqs.~\eqref{eq:recipe} and \eqref{eq:puerto} to vanish then yields the boundary condition
\beq\label{ortho7}
 0  =  g_{\mu\nu} (\partial_{n_\mt{R}} X^\mu+\partial_{n_\mt{L}}X^\mu)
  + \frac{G_\bulk}{G_\brane}\,\inducedK_i \,\partial_\nu x^i\,.
\eeq
\rcm{Am I missing a projection onto the brane or something here?}\vc{Yes, it's the components (index $\nu$) of \eqref{ortho7} along the brane that need to vanish. This is because there is a a contraction with $\delta X^\nu$ in \eqref{eq:recipe} and \eqref{eq:puerto}. Note that $\delta X^\nu$ cannot be chosen arbitrarily. Rather, $\delta X^\nu$ is restricted to be parallel to the brane. (In writing \eqref{eq:recipe}, we have assumed that the same domain of the parametrization coordinates $\xi^a$ maps to the portion of the RT surface on a given side of the brane under both $X^\mu(y^a)$ and $X^\mu(y^a)+\delta X^\mu(y^a)$. Said another way, $S_\bulk$ has the same integration limits in $y^a$ both before and after the variation.) Note that, in the special case $1/G_\brane=0$, the fact the components of $n_\mt{R},-n_\mt{L}$ along the brane are the same implies that $n_\mt{R}=-n_\mt{L}$, since normalization determines the components of $n_\mt{R},n_\mt{L}$ along the only other possible direction they can point. Similarly, when $1/G_\brane\ne 0$, given $n_\mt{R}$, \eqref{ortho7} (projected along the brane directions) contains enough information, together with normalization, to determine $n_\mt{L}$ --- take the components of $n_\mt{R}$ along the brane, add $(G_\bulk/G_\brane)\curvK$ to them, and that gives the components of $-n_\mt{L}$ along the brane; again the remaining degree of freedom in $-n_\mt{L}$ is determined by normalization.}
Hence the brane contribution \reef{eq:facundo} leads to a discontinuity in the first derivative of the RT surface at the brane, as was implicitly found in eq.~\reef{ortho1} above.

\rcm{****} We note that, in the absence of DGP gravity $1/G_\brane=0$, we obtain the orthogonality condition: the tangent $\partial_n X^\mu$ of the RT surface orthogonal to its intersection of the brane, must be orthogonal to the brane. When the brane bisects rather than end the bulk spacetime (\eg for a brane emanating from a defect separating two parts of a CFT), the RT surface approaches the brane from both sides, giving two terms from the boundary contribution in \eqref{eq:maestro}:
\begin{align}
  0
  =& \left.
  \left[
  \frac{g_{\mu\nu} (\partial_n + \partial_{n'})X^\mu}{4 G_\bulk}
  + \frac{\inducedK_i \partial_\nu x^i}{4G_\brane}
  \right] \delta X^\nu
  \right|_{\RT\cap\brane}
  & &(\text{defect brane})
  \\
  =& \left.
  \left[
  \frac{g_{\mu\nu} \partial_n X^\mu}{2 G_\bulk}
  + \frac{\inducedK_i \partial_\nu x^i}{4G_\brane}
  \right] \delta X^\nu
  \right|_{\RT\cap\brane}.
  & &(\text{$\Zbb_2$-symmetry})
  \label{eq:caprice}
\end{align}
Here, $n^\alpha$ and $(n')^\alpha$ are unit normals to the intersection of the RT surface with the brane, as the RT surface approaches the brane from either side. In general, $\partial_n X^\mu|_{\RT\cap\brane}$ and $\partial_{n'}X^\mu|_{\RT\cap\brane}$ need not be individually orthogonal to the brane, even in the absence of DGP gravity. However, in the presence of $\Zbb_2$ symmetry, the extremization problem can be treated as two copies of a corresponding end of the world brane problem (with half the ratio between DGP and bulk gravity). In particular, $g_{\mu\nu}(\partial_n+\partial_{n'})X^\mu \delta X^\nu|_{\RT\cap\brane}=2 g_{\mu\nu} \partial_n X^\mu \delta X^\nu|_{\RT\cap\brane}$, and we obtain \eqref{eq:caprice}. Again, the orthogonality condition is recovered when $1/G_\brane=0$.


\subsection{RT on the Brane}\label{sec:genera}

As alluded to above, one of striking features of EE for subregions in quantum field theory is that the result is dominated by short wavelength modes in the vicinity of the entangling surface and the EE is UV divergent. Of course, the leading contribution is the famous area law term \cite{Sorkin_1983,Bombelli:1986rw,Srednicki:1993im} and in higher dimensions, there are subleading UV divergences which also determined by the geometry of the entangling surface (as well as the dimensionful couplings of the underlying theory). In the holographic context, these divergences arise because the RT surface in the bulk extends out to the asymptotic boundary and hence the unregulated area is infinite \cite{Ryu:2006bv,Ryu:2006ef,Rangamani:2016dms}. In the context of braneworld gravity, like the construction in the previous section with $\s\ll L$, one expects large UV contributions when the RT surface crosses the brane. However, in this instance, the corresponding UV cutoff remains finite and set by the position of the brane, as discussed at the end of section \ref{indyaction}. We show below that the corresponding UV contributions to the holographic EE can be interpreted as the Wald-Dong entropy \cite{Wald:1993nt,Iyer:1994ys,Jacobson:1993vj,Dong:2013qoa}\footnote{Our calculations will include the subleading contributions arising from the curvature-squared terms in eq.~\reef{act3}. Because the corresponding quantum extremal surfaces have nonvanishing extrinsic curvature, we will need the full expression for the gravitational entropy derived by Dong \cite{Dong:2013qoa}.} of the induced gravity on the brane \cite{Emparan:2006ni,Myers:2013lva}. Of course, the leading UV contributions studied here do not probe the full bulk profile of the RT surface, and we leave the full calculation of holographic EE to Section \ref{sec:examples}.

\rcm{*******}

% In this subsection, we wish to study the leading order contributions to holography entanglement entropies for our brane setup in arbitrary dimension. We begin by identifying such contributions coming from the bulk area of the RT surface. Then, we shall show that these contributions match the Wald-Dong entropy of the induced $d$-dimensional gravity action of the brane.


% \subsubsection{Leading bulk RT surface contributions \label{bulkrt}}
\rcm{CAREFUL: is this calculation affected if we have a DGP term and RT surface is not orthogonal to brane??} \vc{I think it's fine now.}
%
\vc{write out Dong-Wald entropy for action \reef{act3} (no derivation!; just refer to refs); show the two contributions found above match this result}


% As before, the bulk consists of two copies of a patch of global AdS$_{d+1}$, glued together along that surface, which creates a spacetime with a tensionfull brane located at that surface. The asymptotic boundary now consists of two copies of a hemisphere cross time, $S^{d-1}\times \mathbb R_t$, glued along a defect. As our entangling region, we choose two identical discs, centered at the pole of each hemisphere, see figure \ref{fig:rtsurface}, which depicts half of the geometry. In this setting, the R-T surface $\RTsurf$ has two different `phases'. The disconnected or `trivial' phase consists of two independent surfaces with the topology of a disc. On the other hand, in the connected phase the R-T surface ends on the brane at some codimension-$3$ surface $ \RTsurf\cap\brane$, which due to symmetry will correspond to a higher dimensional sphere.

  }
  \label{fig:cutoffs}
 }
\end{figure}


% Before solving for the area of the surface between a disk on the lower AdS boundary and the brane we will first understand the dominant behaviour at very large tension and small $\delta_\mt{CFT}$ cutoff, which is a UV cutoff around the CFT boundary. Since we are considering the leading order behaviour, we simply apply the Fefferman-Graham coordinates for some asymptotic metric and set the cutoff in the radial $z$ coordinate. Since the geometry in question is time-independent, we perform all calculations on a fixed timeslice.

% Following Rangamani and Takayanagi's book \cite{Rangamani_2017}, we find that around small $z$ in Fefferman-Graham coordinates the metric on the extremal surface $\RTsurf$ is decomposed as
% \beq
% ds^2_{\RTsurf}=\frac{L^2}{z^2}(dz^2 + \tilde{\gamma}_{a b}d\alpha^a d\alpha^b)\,,
% \eeq where $\alpha_i$ are coordinates on the entangling surface. Assuming that the minimal surface falls straight into the bulk from the CFT boundary, we fix $\xi^1$ to be $z$ and find that the leading contribution to the area at this boundary is
% \beq\label{area}
% A(\RTsurf)_{\delta_B} = \int_{\delta_B}^{z_{IR}}\frac{L^{d-1}dz}{z^{d-1}}\int d\xi^{d-2}\sqrt{\tilde{\gamma}}+\dots=\frac{ L^{d-1}A( \sigma_\mt{CFT})}{(d-2)\delta_B^{d-2}}+\dots\,,
% \eeq where $ \sigma_\mt{CFT}$ is the area of the entangling surface on CFT boundary. We can play the same game at the $\rho=\rho_*$ end of the surface, although in this calculation we ``rebundle" the divergent quantity into the induced metric on the brane, as in (\ref{bundle}).



% \beq\label{branearea}
% A(\RTsurf)_{brane} = \int_{\s}^{z_{IR}} dz \Big[\frac{L^{d-1}}{z^{d-1}}\Big(1+\frac{z^2}{4L^2}\Big)^{d-2}\Big]\int d^{d-2}y \sqrt{\AdSdmetric}\,.
% \eeq
% \josh{The $\tg$ determinant has been decomposed into the $z$-dependent part and the $AdS_d$ bare part. The $z$ part can then just be integrated as in chapter 2.}
% where here $\bar{g}_{AdS_d}$ related to the induced metric on the intersection of the brane and the RT surface (denoted $\bar{g}_{ij}$) by
% \beq
% \bar{g}_{ij} = \frac{L^2}{\s^2}\Big(1+\frac{\s^2}{4L^2}\Big)^2 \bar{g}_{ij}^{AdS_d}\,.
% \eeq
% We now simply integrate over the $z$ direction and find, after expanding at small $s$,
% \beq\label{brane area}
% A(\RTsurf)_{brane} = \frac{L}{d-2}A( \RTsurf\cap\brane) + \frac{1}{2(d-4)}\frac{\s^2}{L}A( \RTsurf\cap\brane) + \mathcal{O}(\s^4/L^4)\,.
% \eeq
% From the calculations above we expect that to leading order
% \beq\label{bulk area}
% \frac{A(\RTsurf)}{4 \Gbk}=\frac{L^{d-1}A( \sigma_\mt{CFT})}{4 (d-2)\Gbk \delta_B^{d-2}} + \frac{L A( \RTsurf\cap\brane)}{4(d-2) \Gbk}\,.
% \eeq Therefore we find
% \beq
% S_{EE} = \frac{2 L^{d-1}A( \sigma_\mt{CFT})}{4 (d-2)\Gbk \delta_B^{d-2}} + \frac{A( \RTsurf\cap\brane)}{4 \Geff}\,,
% \eeq where
% \beq
% \frac{1}{\Geff} = \frac{2 L}{(d-2) }\frac{1}{\Gbk} + \frac{1}{\Gbr}\,,
% \eeq which matches (\ref{Geff}) as was desired. Note that we included two contributions of the bulk area (\ref{bulk area}) to account for both sides of the AdS space. Hence we see that the Wald entropy associated to the induced action term is really contained in the bulk RT surface and not a genuine generalized correction to the entanglement entropy. In section \ref{Wald}, we compare the second order term of equation (\ref{brane area}) to the Wald entropy for the curvature-squared terms of the induced action.


We consider the area functional \eqref{eq:badNotation}, with $X^\mu=(z,x^i)$, as in slicing coordinates \eqref{metric3a}, and $\xi^\alpha=(z,y^a)$ for some arbitrary $(d-2)$-many coordinates $y^a$ of the brane. We can expand the transversal profile $X^i=x^i(\xi)$ of the brane in $z$, giving
\beq\label{run11}
x^i(z,y^a) = x^{(0)i}(y^a) + \frac{z^2}{L^2}x^{(1)i}(y^a) + O\left(\frac{z^4}{L^4}\right)
\eeq
The, functions $x^{(n)i}(y^a)$ can in principle be found recursively through extremization of the area of the RT surface; however, we will simply quote the result \cite{Hung_2011}:
\beq
x^{(1)i} = -\frac{L^4 \inducedK^i}{2(d-2) \s^2}\,,
\eeq
with $\inducedK^i$ the extrinsic curvature of the intersection between the brane and the RT surface $\RTsurf$, with respect to the brane. Here, $\inducedK_{iab} = \partial_i h_{ab}$ with $h_{ab}$ being the induced metric on the intersection of the RT surface and the brane, and the index $i$ projected normal to this intersection. Traces and raising and lowering of indices shall be performed with induced metrics; \eg $\inducedK^i \sim O(\inducedK_i \s^2/L^2)$. \vc{I'm trying to choose the normalization of $\inducedK$ to match with \cite{Dong:2013qoa}. I believe our $\inducedK^i$ is $-\s^2/L^2$ times the one in \cite{Hung_2011} (which I think has its index raised using the boundary CFT metric)--- is this correct?} With this, the non-vanishing components of the induced metric $h_{\alpha\beta}$, defined in \eqref{eq:badNotation}, read
\begin{align}
% h_{zz} =& \frac{L^2}{z^2}\Big(1+\frac{z^2}{L^2}h_{zz}^{(1)}+\dots\Big),
\RTmetric_{zz}
=& \frac{L^2}{z^2}\left[
1 + \frac{z^2}{L^2} h_{zz}^{(1)} + O\left(\frac{z^4}{L^4}\right)
\right],
\label{eq:bacardi}\\
% h_{ab}=&\frac{L^2}{z^2}\Big(h^{(0)}_{ab}+\frac{z^2}{L^2}h^{(1)}_{ab}+\dots\Big)\,.
\RTmetric_{ab}
=& \frac{L^2}{z^2}\left(1+\frac{z^2}{4L^2}\right)^2 \QESmetricNoz_{ab},
&
\QESmetricNoz_{ab}
\equiv& \AdSdmetric_{ij}
\frac{\partial x^i}{\partial y^a}
\frac{\partial x^j}{\partial y^b}
= \QESmetricNoz_{ab}^{(0)}
+ \frac{z^2}{L^2} \QESmetricNoz_{ab}^{(1)}
+ O\left(\frac{z^4}{L^4}\right)
\label{eq:jackDaniels}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  \RTmetric_{zz}^{(1)}=& \frac{4}{L^2} \AdSdmetric_{ij} x^{(1)i} x^{(1)j}
  = \frac{L^6}{(d-2)^2 \s^4} \AdSdmetric_{ij} \inducedK^i \inducedK^j
  \sim \frac{L^4}{(d-2)^2 \s^2} \inducedK_i \inducedK^i
  \label{eq:zirkova}
  \\
  \QESmetricNoz_{ab}^{(0)}
  =& \AdSdmetric_{ij}
  \frac{\partial x^{(0)i}}{\partial y^a}
  \frac{\partial x^{(0)j}}{\partial y^b}
\end{align}
\rcm{Comment: I am not a fan of all this funky notation.}
While we will not need an expression for the individual components of $\QESmetricNoz^{(1)}_{ab}$, we will instead use
\begin{align}
  \sqrt{\QESmetricNoz}
  =& \sqrt{\QESmetricNoz^{(0)}}\left[
  1 + \frac{z^2}{L^2} \inducedK_i x^{(1)j}
  + O\left(\frac{z^4}{L^4}\right)
  \right]
  \\
  =& \sqrt{\QESmetricNoz^{(0)}}\left[
  1 - \frac{L^2 z^2}{2(d-2)\s^2} \inducedK_i \inducedK^i
  + O\left(\frac{z^4}{L^4}\right)
  \right]
  \label{eq:absolut}
\end{align}
which comes from using the expansion $\inducedK_i$ to obtain the area element $\sqrt{\QESmetricNoz}$ at $x^i(z,y^a)$ as a perturbation from $\sqrt{\QESmetricNoz^{(0)}}$ at $x^{(0)i}(y^a)$ due to a shift by $z^2 x^{(1)j}/L^2$. With \eqref{eq:bacardi} and \eqref{eq:jackDaniels}, the area functional \eqref{eq:badNotation} now reads
\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
  \frac{\area(\bulkbndry)}{4 G_\bulk}
  =& \frac{1}{4 G_\bulk} \int dz\;\Bigg\{
  \left(\frac{L}{z}\right)^{d-1}
  \left(1+\frac{z^2}{4L^2}\right)^{d-2}
  \\
  &\times \int d^{d-2}y\; \sqrt{
  \QESmetricNoz
  }
  \left[
  1 + \frac{z^2}{2L^2} \RTmetric^{(1)}_{zz}
  + O\left(\frac{z^4}{L^4}\right)
  \right]
  \Bigg\}
\end{split}
\end{align}
Further plugging in \eqref{eq:zirkova} and \eqref{eq:absolut}, we may integrate in $z$ to obtain the leading UV contributions near the brane:
\begin{align}
  \frac{\area(\bulkbndry)}{4 G_\bulk}
  \sim&
  \frac{1}{4 G_\bulk}
  \left(
  \frac{2L}{d-2}
  + \frac{\s^2}{(d-4)L}
  \right)\area(\bulkbndry\cap\brane)
  \\
  &- \frac{L^3}{4(d-2)^2 (d-4) G_\bulk}
  \int d^{d-2}y\; \sqrt{\det(\RTmetric_{ab})} \inducedK_i \inducedK^i
  + O\left(\frac{\s^4}{L^4}\right),
  \label{eq:bazinga}
  \end{align}
  where
  \begin{align}
  A(\sigma\cap\brane)
  =& \int d^{d-2}y\; \sqrt{\det(h_{ab})}
  \\
  \begin{split}
  =& \int dz\;\Bigg\{
  \left(\frac{L}{z}\right)^{d-2}
  \left(1+\frac{z^2}{4L^2}\right)^{d-2}
  \\
  &\times \int d^{d-2}y\;
  \sqrt{\QESmetricNoz^{(0)}}\left[
  1 - \frac{L^2 z^2}{2(d-2)\s^2} \inducedK_i \inducedK^i
  + O\left(\frac{z^4}{L^4}\right)
  \right]
  \Bigg\}.
\end{split}
\end{align}
In \eqref{eq:bazinga}, we have included a factor of $2$ to account for the pieces of the RT surface on the two sides of the brane.
% Alternatively, written in terms of $G_\eff$,
% \begin{align}
%   \begin{split}
%   \frac{\area(\bulkbndry)}{4 G_\bulk}
%   + \frac{\area(\partial(\islands))}{4 G_\brane}
%   =& \frac{1}{4G_\eff}\left[
%   1 + \frac{(d-2)\s^2}{2(d-4)L^2}
%   \right] \area(\bulkbndry \cap\brane)
%   \\
%   &+ \frac{L^2}{8(d-2)(d-4)G_\eff}
%   \int d^{d-2}y\; \sqrt{\det(\RTmetric_{ab})} \inducedK_i \inducedK^i
%   + O\left(\frac{\s^4}{L^4}\right)
% \end{split}
% \end{align}
% where we have assumed the lack of DGP gravity.

We now show that \eqref{eq:bazinga} matches the Wald-Dong entropy formula \cite{Dong:2013qoa}
\beq\label{dong}
S = 4\pi \int d^{d-2}y \sqrt{\det(h_{ab})}
\left[
\lambda_0
+2 \lambda_1 \tilde{R}
+\lambda_2 \left(
\inducedR_{ij} n^{im} \tensor{n}{^j_m}
-\frac{1}{2}
\inducedK_i
\inducedK^i
\right)
\right]\,,
\eeq
for the gravity action
\begin{align}
  \int d^d x\; \sqrt{\inducedg} \left(
  \lambda_{-1} + \lambda_0 \inducedR + \lambda_1 \inducedR^2
  +\lambda_2 \inducedR^{ij} \inducedR_{ij}
  \right).
  \label{eq:woopie}
\end{align}
Here, $h_{ab}$ and $n^i_m$ are the induced metric and unit normals of the entangling surface embedded in the $d$-dimensional spacetime with metric $\inducedg_{ij}$. The tildes denote geometric quantities evaluated using $\inducedg_{ij}$. The coefficients $\lambda_{-1},\ldots,\lambda_2$ are constants, which for us, are chosen so that \eqref{eq:woopie} matches the induced brane gravity action \eqref{totaction}. In particular,
\begin{align}
  \lambda_0
  =& \frac{L}{8\pi (d-2) G_\bulk}
  \\
  \lambda_1
  =& -\frac{d L^3}{32 \pi (d-1)(d-2)^2(d-4) G_\bulk}
  \\
  \lambda_2
  =& \frac{L^3}{8\pi (d-2)^2 (d-4) G_\bulk}.
\end{align}
Immediately, we see that the $O(\s^0/L^0)$ area term and extrinsic curvature term of \eqref{eq:bazinga} match the first and last terms of \eqref{dong}. Using \eqref{curve1} and \eqref{Ricky2}, we find that the remaining two terms in \eqref{dong},
\begin{align}
  \MoveEqLeft[3]4\pi \int d^{d-2}y \sqrt{\det(h_{ab})}
  \left[
  2 \lambda_1 \tilde{R}
  +\lambda_2
  \inducedR_{ij} n^{im} \tensor{n}{^j_m}
  \right]
  \\
  =& 4\pi \int d^{d-2}y \sqrt{\det(h_{ab})}
  \left[
  -\frac{2d(d-1)\s^2}{L^4} \lambda_1
  -\frac{2(d-1)\s^2}{L^4} \lambda_2
  \right]
\end{align}
sum to the $O(\s^2/L^2)$ area term of \eqref{eq:bazinga}. Hence, we see that bulk RT formula produces leading UV contributions near the brane which correspond to the Wald-Dong entropy of the induced gravity on the brane.

% \vc{
% \begin{align}
% h_{zz} =& \frac{L^2}{z^2}\Big(1+\frac{z^2}{L^2}h_{zz}^{(1)}+\dots\Big),
% % h_{zz}

% \end{align}
% Note that $h_{ab}=\tilde{g}_{ab}|_{\RTsurf\cap\brane}$ is the induced metric at the intersection of the RT surface and the brane. Now when we studied the behaviour of the RT surface in equation (\ref{branearea}), we assumed that the brane fell straight into the bulk, which is why the extrinsic curvature contributions did not appear. The correct expansion around the brane is \cite{Hung_2011}
% \begin{multline}\label{correctedarea}
%  A(\RTsurf)_{brane} = \int_{\s}^{z_{IR}}dz \Big[\frac{L^{d-1}}{z^{d-1}}\Big(1+\frac{z^2}{4L^2}\Big)^{d-2}\Big]\int d^{d-2}x \sqrt{-\AdSdmetric} \\\times\Big[1+\Big(h^{(1)}_{zz}+h^{(0)ab}h^{(1)}_{ab}\Big)\frac{z^2}{2L^2}+\dots \Big]\,,
% \end{multline} where we notice that the first-order term was the contribution evaluated already. We now focus on the second order term. To raise the indices in the $h^{(0)ab}$, we used the metric $h^{ab}$, which is order $z^2/L^2$. Hence we see that at second order we only need to focus on the $h^{(1)}_{zz}$ term. \josh{Check this is correct, i.e. this second term is indeed subdominant. ALSO, double-check that $\tilde{\mathcal{K}}_i$ is the same as the $K_i$ in Dong.} \vc{$h^{(0)ab}$ is just the inverse of $h^{(0)}_{ab}$ and isn't suppressed.}

% \subsubsection{Wald entropies \label{Wald}}
%
% In the generalized entanglement entropy there are contributions from the brane action which take the form of the Wald entropy, as justified in section \ref{waldjustification}.
%
% We start by computing the Wald entropy for the standard Einstein-Hilbert action because of its relevance to both the induced brane action and physical brane action. The Wald entropy formula is \cite{Myers:2010tj}
% \beq
% S = -2\pi \int_{\mathcal{R}}d^{d-2}x\sqrt{-h}\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial R^{ab}_{\,\,\,\,\,cd}}\hat{\epsilon}^{ab}\hat{\epsilon}_{cd}\,,
% \eeq where $\mathcal{L}$ is the Lagrangian density and $\hat{\epsilon}_{ab}$ is the binormal to some region $\mathcal{R}$, and $h_{ij}=\tilde{g}_{ij}$ is the induced metric along that region. In our setup, $\mathcal{R}\equiv \RTsurf\cap\brane$ is the ($d-2$)-dimensional intersection surface between the brane and the bulk Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface. As in section \ref{bulkrt}, we refer to the induced metric along this surface by $\bar{g}_{ij}$, which is simply the restriction of $\tilde{g}$ to the surface $\RTsurf\cap\brane$.
%
% Note that the integrand is constant along the brane in our geometry so the equation reduces to
% \beq
% S = -2\pi \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial R^{ab}_{\,\,\,\,\,cd}}\hat{\epsilon}^{ab}\hat{\epsilon}_{cd}\int_{\RTsurf\cap\brane}d^{d-2}x\sqrt{-\bar{g}} = -2\pi \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial R^{ab}_{\,\,\,\,\,cd}}\hat{\epsilon}^{ab}\hat{\epsilon}_{cd} A(\RTsurf\cap\brane) \,.
% \eeq
% The Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian density takes the form
% \beq
% \mathcal{L} = \alpha \tilde{R} = \alpha \tilde{R}^{ab}_{\,\,\,\,\,cd} \tilde{g}^{ic}\tilde{g}^{jd}\tilde{g}_{ai}\tilde{g}_{bj}\,
% \eeq from which we compute
% \beq
% \hat{\epsilon}^{ab}\hat{\epsilon}_{cd}\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial \tilde{R}^{ab}_{\,\,\,\,\,cd}} =\alpha \hat{\epsilon}^{ab}\hat{\epsilon}_{cd} \tilde{g}^{ic}\tilde{g}^{jd}\tilde{g}_{ai}\tilde{g}_{bj} = -2 \alpha\,,
% \eeq where we used $\hat{\epsilon}^{ij}\hat{\epsilon}_{ij} = -2$ from \cite{Myers:2010tj}. For the actions on the brane, this gives the standard result
% \beq
% S_{brane} = \frac{A(\RTsurf\cap\brane)}{4 \Gbr}\,\,\,\,\,\text{and}\,\,\,\,\, S_{induced}^{(1)} = \frac{L A(\RTsurf\cap\brane)}{4(d-2)\Gbk}\,.
% \eeq These standard results were already used at the end of section \ref{bulkrt}. As promised, we can use this formalism to study the higher curvature terms in the induced brane action to ensure that they provide the same information as the area of the bulk RT surface.
%
% We first consider the two curvature-squared terms independently, which will be combined by linearity. Consider the Lagrangian density
% \beq
% \mathcal{L} = \kappa R^2\implies \hat{\epsilon}^{ab}\hat{\epsilon}_{cd}\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial R^{ab}_{\,\,\,\,\,cd}} = - 4 \kappa R\,.
% \eeq Also, we need to consider
% \beq\label{RicciTensorTerm}
% \mathcal{L} = \gamma R^{de}R_{de} =\gamma R^{ab}_{\,\,\,\,\,cd}R^{\,\,\,\,\,ld}_{jk}g_{ai}g_{be}g^{ic}g_{jm}g_{ml}g^{ke}\implies \hat{\epsilon}^{ab}\hat{\epsilon}_{cd}\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial R^{ab}_{\,\,\,\,\,cd}} =-4\gamma\hat{R}\,,
% \eeq
% whenever $R_{ij} = \hat{R}g_{ij}$.
% Now we turn to the curvature-squared terms of the induced bulk action (\ref{bulkaction}). Applying the variations above, we find
% \beq
% S_{induced}^{(2)} = \frac{8 L^3 \s^2}{(d-4)(4L^2+\s^2)^2}\frac{A(\RTsurf\cap\brane)}{4 \Gbk}\,.
% \eeq Now expanding this to leading order in $s$, we find
% \beq
% S_{induced}^{(2)} = \frac{ \s^2}{2(d-4)L}\frac{A(\RTsurf\cap\brane)}{4 \Gbk}\,,
% \eeq which matches the analogous term from \ref{brane area}.
%
% \subsubsection{Dong entropies and extrinsic curvature corrections}
%
% So far we ignored the extrinsic curvatures of the entangling surface on the brane. Following \cite{Bhattacharyya_2014_2, Dong_2014}, we consider a second derivative theory of gravity ($\mathcal{L}^{(2)} = \lambda_1 \tilde{R}^2 + \lambda_2 \tilde{R}_{\mu\nu}\tilde{R}^{\mu\nu}$) with entropy \vc{I vaguely recall that Dong defines his Lagrangians and actions with a minus sign relative to the usual definition. See, for example, (3.35) which would give a negative area term for entropy if an Einstein Hilbert action with the usual sign is used. I think the minus sign he puts in front of the $S$ in (2.4) is inconsistent with his convention for the rest of the paper, \eg see (2.12). Also, his formulas are for Euclidean signature. For us, I think we should scrap the minus sign out front in \eqref{dong}.}
% \beq\label{dong}
% S = -4\pi \int d^{d-2}x \sqrt{-\bar{g}}\Big[2 \lambda_1 \tilde{R} +\lambda_2 \Big(\tilde{R}_{\mu\nu}n_i^{\mu}n_i^{\nu}-\frac{1}{2}\tilde{\mathcal{K}}_i\tilde{\mathcal{K}}^i\Big)\Big]\,,
% \eeq where $n_i$'s are the two normals to the entangling surface. Note that in our setup,

% \tilde{R}_{\mu\nu}n_i^{\mu}n_i^{\nu} = \hat{R}\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}n_i^{\mu}n_i^{\nu} = \hat{R}\sum_{i=1}^2 n_i^{\mu}n_{i \mu} = 2\hat{R}\,,
% \eeq where we used the normalization of the normal vector. This contribution to the entropy agrees with equation (\ref{RicciTensorTerm}). In our calculations below we consider only the one-sided bulk. Including both contributions simply requires a factor of two multiplying the Dong entropy.
%
% We now present an argument to show that the minimal surface calculation also includes the extrinsic term of equation (\ref{dong}). The argument follows \cite{Hung_2011}.

%
% It was shown in \cite{Hung_2011} that the second-order contribution to the RT surface embedding coordinates can be written in terms of the extrinsic curvature,
% \beq
% X^{(1)i} = \frac{L^2 \tilde{\mathcal{K}}^i}{2(d-2)}\,,
% \eeq and the induced metric can be expanded via
% \beq
% h_{zz} = \frac{L^2}{z^2}\Big(1+\frac{4z^2}{L^4}(X^{(1)i})^2+\dots\Big)\implies h^{(1)}_{zz} = \frac{L^2 (\tilde{\mathcal{K}}^i)^2}{(d-2)^2}\,.
% \eeq
% We now substitute this expression into equation (\ref{correctedarea}) and integrate out the $z$ direction. Upon expanding at small $\s$, we obtain
% \beq
% A(\RTsurf)^{(1)}_{brane} = \frac{L \s^2}{2 (d-4)(d-2)^2}(\tilde{\mathcal{K}}^i)^2 \int d^{d-2}x \sqrt{-\tilde{g}}\,,
% \eeq and hence the second order contribution to the entanglement entropy is
% \beq
% S^{(1)} = \frac{1}{4 \Gbk} \frac{L \s^2}{2 (d-4)(d-2)^2}(\tilde{\mathcal{K}}^i)^2 A(\RTsurf\cap\brane)\,,
% \eeq which precisely matches equation (\ref{dong}) after computing $\lambda_2$ from the induced brane action (\ref{bulkaction}),
% \beq
% \lambda_2= \frac{L^3}{16 \pi(d-4)(d-2)^2 \Gbk}\,.
% \eeq
% \josh{I need to be a bit more careful... the left over $s^2/L^2$ comes from the raising and lowering of the $i$ indices compared to Dong's formula or from the metric in Dong's formula?.}
% From these calculations we conclude that the entropies associated to the induced action on the brane in the Randall-Sundrum picture give exactly the leading contributions to the RT surface area in the $(d+1)$-dimensional bulk!

\subsection*{A comment on $d=2$ case} \label{DeeTwo}
\rcm{comment that we can only get contributions of $\ric$ or $\ric^2$ terms with details of profile. Is that true??} \vc{I think so. This was another reason I wanted to treat these as part of the matter effective action rather than as part of a gravitational action \Smiley. I don't think applying the Wald-Dong entropy formula to the finite part in \eqref{induct} will ever recover the bulk profile of the RT surface, even if the $\cdots$ are continued to arbitrarily high orders.}

\rcm{note to leading order contributions derived from eq.~\reef{induct} or from eq.~\reef{PolyAct2} and then substituting eq.~\reef{sol4} match. Would this be true beyond leading order??}

% We see that the equations are slightly different in $d=2$ since the calculation in (\ref{area}) will introduce a log rather than a powerlaw behaviour. This will again match the RS-picture side.

To close this section, we briefly remark that the $d=2$ case is somewhat special in that the intersection between the RT surface and the brane is a point. Consequently, the leading UV contribution to entropy is not a standard area term, but rather a logarithmic term. Integrating the RT area (in this case, length) gives
% The leading order behaviour of the bulk RT surface is just a single integral,
\beq
S
\sim \frac{1}{2 G_\bulk}\int \frac{L}{z}dz
\sim \frac{L}{2G_\bulk} \log\left(\frac{L_\IR}{\s}\right)\,,
\label{eq:kaboom}
\eeq
Here, we have selected out the contribution due to the RT surface approaching the brane and we have introduced an IR length scale $L_\IR$ to make the argument of the logarithm dimensionless. A factor of two has been included to account for both sides of the brane. This can also be obtained by evaluating the Wald entropy formula \cite{Wald:1993nt} (see also eq.~(3.35) in \cite{Dong:2013qoa}) for the induced gravity action \eqref{induct} with Lagrangian $\sqrt{-\inducedg}\Lcal(\inducedR)$:
% We also take the variation of the $d=2$ induced action to compute its Wald entropy \cite{Dong_2014}. We find
\begin{align}
 S
 =& 4\pi \frac{\partial \Lcal(\inducedR)}{\partial \inducedR}
 \sim -\frac{1}{4G_\eff} \log\left(-\frac{L^2 \inducedR}{2}\right)
 \sim \frac{L}{2G_\bulk} \log\left(\frac{L}{\s}\right)
 % \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \tilde{R}} = \frac{1}{4 G_{3}}\frac{\partial }{\partial \tilde{R}}\Big(\frac{2}{L} -\frac{1}{2}L \tilde{R} \log\Big(-\frac{L^2}{ 2} \tilde{R}\Big) + \frac{L}{2}\tilde{R}+\frac{L^3}{16}\tilde{R}^2\Big)\\=-\frac{L}{4G_3} \log\Big(\frac{\s}{L}\Big)\,,
\end{align}
in agreement with \eqref{eq:kaboom} upon setting $L_\IR=L$. Alternatively, one may apply this formula to the Lagrangian for the Polyakov-Liouville action \eqref{PolyAct2}, giving the same answer upon setting $\phi$ equal to the on-shell value \eqref{sol4}.
% which matches the RT surface calculation (after expanding to leading order in $\s$)!
