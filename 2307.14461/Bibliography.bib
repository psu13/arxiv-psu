In this paper we improve on the definition of strong compact closure as compared to the one presented in Categorical Semantics of Quantum Protocols. This modification enables an elegant characterization of strong compact closure in terms of adjoints and a Yanking axiom, and a better treatment of bipartite projectors.},

abstract = {We use the mathematical language of sheaf theory to give a unified treatment of non-locality and contextuality, in a setting which generalizes the familiar probability tables used in non-locality theory to arbitrary measurement covers; this includes Kochen-Specker configurations and more. We show that contextuality, and non-locality as a special case, correspond exactly to obstructions to the existence of global sections. We describe a linear algebraic approach to computing these obstructions, which allows a systematic treatment of arguments for non-locality and contextuality. We distinguish a proper hierarchy of strengths of no-go theorems, and show that three leading examples --- due to Bell, Hardy, and Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger, respectively --- occupy successively higher levels of this hierarchy. A general correspondence is shown between the existence of local hidden-variable realizations using negative probabilities, and no-signalling; this is based on a result showing that the linear subspaces generated by the non-contextual and no-signalling models, over an arbitrary measurement cover, coincide. Maximal non-locality is generalized to maximal contextuality, and characterized in purely qualitative terms, as the non-existence of global sections in the support. A general setting is developed for Kochen-Specker type results, as generic, model-independent proofs of maximal contextuality, and a new combinatorial condition is given, which generalizes the `parity proofs' commonly found in the literature. We also show how our abstract setting can be represented in quantum mechanics. This leads to a strengthening of the usual no-signalling theorem, which shows that quantum mechanics obeys no-signalling for arbitrary families of commuting observables, not just those represented on different factors of a tensor product.},

We show how sheaf theory can model the contextual nature of natural language and how gluing can be used to provide a global semantics for a discourse by putting together the local logical semantics of each sentence within the discourse. We introduce a presheaf structure corresponding to a basic form of Discourse Representation Structures. Within this setting, we formulate a notion of semantic unification \textemdash{} gluing meanings of parts of a discourse into a coherent whole \textemdash{} as a form of sheaf-theoretic gluing. We illustrate this idea with a number of examples where it can used to represent resolutions of anaphoric references. We also discuss multivalued gluing, described using a distributions functor, which can be used to represent situations where multiple gluings are possible, and where we may need to rank them using quantitative measures.

Concept representations that are built using geometric and topological conceptual space structures are well suited for semantic similarity and concept combination operations. In addition, concepts that are more closely grounded in the physical world, such as many spatial concepts, have a natural fit with the geometric structure of conceptual spaces. Despite these apparent advantages, conceptual spaces are underutilized because existing formalizations of conceptual space theory have focused on individual aspects of the theory rather than the creation of a comprehensive algebra. In this paper we present a metric conceptual space algebra that is designed to facilitate the creation of conceptual space knowledge bases and inferencing systems. Conceptual regions are represented as convex polytopes and context is built in as a fundamental element. We demonstrate the applicability of the algebra to spatial information systems with a proof-of-concept application.},

We give several characterizations of this equivalence including one in terms of Honda and Tokoro's bisimulation, and one in terms of barbed equivalence. We show that this bisimulation is preserved by name substitutions, hence by input prefix. Finally, we give a complete axiomatization of the (strong) bisimulation for finite terms.},

author = {Ashoush, Daniela},

institution = {{University of Oxford}},
abstract = {The categorical compositional distributional model of Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark combines the distributional theory of meaning in terms of vectors space models, and the compositional model of meaning in terms of pregroup gram- mars, in a unified categorical setting. It provides a way of computing the meaning of sentences and strings of words based on the grammatical relation- ships between the different constituents, and the empirical meaning vectors of individual words: the grammatical reductions of pregroups are lifted to mor- phisms in vector spaces. This is based on the fact that pregroup grammars and vector spaces share a compact-closed structure. In the aim of modeling a feature of language, this framework was extended to include mixed states by the means of Selinger's CPM-construction. This translates into the passage from vectors to density matrices. Two applications of this extension are modelling lexical ambiguity, and modelling entailment relationships between words. The aim of this dissertation is to further extend the model of Coecke et al. by iterating the CPM-construction in order to accommodate for two features of language: ambiguity and entailment. We present an axiomatisation of the CPM2-construction and generalise it to axiomatise the CPMn-construction \textendash{} which has the potential to accommodate for an increasing number of features. The CPM2-construction preserves \textdagger -compact closed structure, and ensures that the grammatical reductions are carried over to the new category. We then study the structure of double-density matrices, new states introduced by the CPM2-construction, and investigate their role in accounting for both lexical ambiguity and entailment. This framework is showed to successfully model the two features of language via a series of examples, and is equipped with independent measures of the levels of ambiguity and entailment in words.},

While reaction networks are mainly studied by chemists, they are equivalent to Petri nets, which are used for similar purposes in computer science and biology. As noted by Doi and others, techniques from quantum field theory can be adapted to apply to such systems. Here we use these techniques to study how the "master equation" describing stochastic time evolution for a reaction network is related to the "rate equation" describing the deterministic evolution of the expected number of particles of each species in the large-number limit. We show that the relation is especially strong when a solution of master equation is a "coherent state", meaning that the numbers of entities of each kind are described by independent Poisson distributions.},

For any field k we give a presentation of FinVect\_k in terms of the generators used in signal flow diagrams. A broader class of signal-flow diagrams also includes "caps" and "cups" to model feedback. We show these diagrams can be seen as string diagrams for the symmetric monoidal category FinRel\_k, where objects are still finite-dimensional vector spaces but the morphisms are linear relations. We also give a presentation for FinRel\_k. The relations say, among other things, that the 1-dimensional vector space k has two special commutative dagger-Frobenius structures, such that the multiplication and unit of either one and the comultiplication and counit of the other fit together to form a bimonoid. This sort of structure, but with tensor product replacing direct sum, is familiar from the "ZX-calculus" obeyed by a finite-dimensional Hilbert space with two mutually unbiased bases.},

In this category, composition describes the process of attaching the outputs of one circuit to the inputs of another. We construct a functor, dubbed the "black box functor", that takes a circuit, forgets its internal structure, and remembers only its external behavior. Two circuits have the same external behavior if and only if they impose same relation between currents and potentials at their terminals. The space of these currents and potentials naturally has the structure of a symplectic vector space, and the relation imposed by a circuit is a Lagrangian linear relation. Thus, the black box functor goes from our category of circuits to the category of symplectic vector spaces and Lagrangian linear relations. We prove that this functor is a symmetric monoidal dagger functor between dagger compact categories. We assume the reader has some familiarity with category theory, but none with circuit theory or symplectic linear algebra.},

We show that the behavior of a detailed balanced open Markov process is determined by a principle of minimum dissipation, closely related to Prigogine's principle of minimum entropy production. Using this fact, we set up a functor mapping open detailed balanced Markov processes to open circuits made of linear resistors. We also describe how to "black box" an open Markov process, obtaining the linear relation between input and output data that holds in any steady state, including nonequilibrium steady states with a nonzero flow of probability through the system. We prove that black boxing gives a symmetric monoidal dagger functor sending open detailed balanced Markov processes to Lagrangian relations between symplectic vector spaces. This allows us to compute the steady state behavior of an open detailed balanced Markov process from the behaviors of smaller pieces from which it is built.

We then turn to statics: that is, steady state solutions of open dynamical systems.

abstract = {Long before the invention of Feynman diagrams, engineers were using similar diagrams to reason about electrical circuits and more general networks containing mechanical, hydraulic, thermodynamic and chemical components. We can formalize this reasoning using props: that is, strict symmetric monoidal categories where the objects are natural numbers, with the tensor product of objects given by addition. In this approach, each kind of network corresponds to a prop, and each network of this kind is a morphism in that prop. A network with \$m\$ inputs and \$n\$ outputs is a morphism from \$m\$ to \$n\$, putting networks together in series is composition, and setting them side by side is tensoring. Here we work out the details of this approach for various kinds of electrical circuits, starting with circuits made solely of ideal perfectly conductive wires, then circuits with passive linear components, and then circuits that also have voltage and current sources. Each kind of circuit corresponds to a mathematically natural prop. We describe the "behavior" of these circuits using morphisms between props. In particular, we give a new proof of the black-boxing theorem proved by Fong and the first author; unlike the original proof, this new one easily generalizes to circuits with nonlinear components. We also use a morphism of props to clarify the relation between circuit diagrams and the signal-flow diagrams in control theory. Technically, the key tools are the Rosebrugh-Sabadini-Walters result relating circuits to special commutative Frobenius monoids, the monadic adjunction between props and signatures, and a result saying which symmetric monoidal categories are equivalent to props.},

abstract = {Petri networks and network models are two frameworks for the compositional design of systems of interacting entities. Here we show how to combine them using the concept of a `catalyst': an entity that is neither destroyed nor created by any process it engages in. In a Petri net, a place is a catalyst if its in-degree equals its out-degree for every transition. We show how a Petri net with a chosen set of catalysts gives a network model. This network model maps any list of catalysts from the chosen set to the category whose morphisms are all the processes enabled by this list of catalysts. Applying the Grothendieck construction, we obtain a category fibered over the category whose objects are lists of catalysts. This category has as morphisms all processes enabled by some list of catalysts. While this category has a symmetric monoidal structure that describes doing processes in parallel, its fibers also have premonoidal structures that describe doing one process and then another while reusing the catalysts.},

Different network models describe different kinds of networks. We show that each network model gives rise to an operad, whose operations are ways of assembling a network of the given kind from smaller parts. Such operads, and their algebras, can serve as tools for designing networks. Technically, a network model is a lax symmetric monoidal functor from the free symmetric monoidal category on some set to \$\textbackslash mathbf\{Cat\}\$, and the construction of the corresponding operad proceeds via a symmetric monoidal version of the Grothendieck construction.},

For us an "open" Petri net is one with certain places designated as inputs and outputs via a cospan of sets. We can compose open Petri nets by gluing the outputs of one to the inputs of another. Open Petri nets can be treated as morphisms of a category \$\textbackslash mathsf\{Open\}(\textbackslash mathsf\{Petri\})\$, which becomes symmetric monoidal under disjoint union. However, since the composite of open Petri nets is defined only up to isomorphism, it is better to treat them as morphisms of a symmetric monoidal double category \$\textbackslash mathbb\{O\}\textbackslash mathbf\{pen\}(\textbackslash mathsf\{Petri\})\$. We describe two forms of semantics for open Petri nets using symmetric monoidal double functors out of \$\textbackslash mathbb\{O\}\textbackslash mathbf\{pen\}(\textbackslash mathsf\{Petri\})\$. The first, an operational semantics, gives for each open Petri net a category whose morphisms are the processes that this net can carry out. This is done in a compositional way, so that these categories can be computed on smaller subnets and then glued together. The second, a reachability semantics, simply says which markings of the outputs can be reached from a given marking of the inputs.},

The encoding preserves strong and weak CCS asynchronous bisimilarities: it thus represents a relevant step in establishing a precise correspondence between asynchronous calculi and (open) Petri nets.

In particular, two exemplary calculi are considered: (asynchronous) CCS and CSP, representing alternative interaction paradigms, namely asynchronous and (broadcast) synchronous communication. The encoding is proved to preserve as well as to reflect the operational semantics. As a consequence, it is well-behaved with respect to the standard behavioural equivalences, a fact that is exploited to perform a ``technology transfer'' between the two formalisms, in terms of un/decidability results for classical properties such as reachability and deadlock-freedom.},

abstract = {The categorical compositional distributional model of natural language provides a conceptually motivated procedure to compute the meaning of sentences, given grammatical structure and the meanings of its words. This approach has outperformed other models in mainstream empirical language processing tasks. However, until recently it has lacked the crucial feature of lexical entailment -- as do other distributional models of meaning. In this paper we solve the problem of entailment for categorical compositional distributional semantics. Taking advantage of the abstract categorical framework allows us to vary our choice of model. This enables the introduction of a notion of entailment, exploiting ideas from the categorical semantics of partial knowledge in quantum computation. The new model of language uses density matrices, on which we introduce a novel robust graded order capturing the entailment strength between concepts. This graded measure emerges from a general framework for approximate entailment, induced by any commutative monoid. Quantum logic embeds in our graded order. Our main theorem shows that entailment strength lifts compositionally to the sentence level, giving a lower bound on sentence entailment. We describe the essential properties of graded entailment such as continuity, and provide a procedure for calculating entailment strength.},

While this law has been used to describe the effectiveness of systems in self-regulation, the consequences for failure have not been formalized. Here we use this law to consider the internal dynamics of an unstructured system, and its response to a structured environment. We find that, due to its inability to respond, a completely unstructured system is inherently unstable to the formation of structure. And in general, any system without structure above a certain scale is unable to withstand structure arising above that scale. To describe complicated internal dynamics, we develop a characterization of multiscale changes in a system. This characterization is motivated by Shannon information theoretic ideas of noise, but considers structured information. We then relate our findings to political anarchism showing that society requires some organizing processes, even if there is no traditional government or hierarchies. We also formulate our findings as an inverse second law of thermodynamics; while closed systems collapse into disorder, systems open to a structured environment spontaneously generate order.},

Experiment 1 found that central tendency did not predict graded structure in goal-derived categories, although it did predict graded structure in common taxonomic categories. Ideals and frequency of instantiation predicted graded structure in both category types to sizeable and equal extents. A fourth possible determinant--familiarity--did not predict typicality in either common taxonomic or goal-derived categories. Experiment 2 demonstrated that both central tendency and ideals causally determine graded structure, and work showing that frequency causally determines graded structure is discussed. Experiment 2 also demonstrated that the determinants of a particular category's graded structure can change with context. Whereas ideals may determine a category's graded structure in one context, central tendency may determine a different graded structure in another. It is proposed that graded structures do not reflect invariant structures associated with categories but instead reflect people's dynamic ability to construct concepts.},

The three methods were combined in a hybrid system that classified six upper facial actions with 91\% accuracy. The hybrid system outperformed human nonexperts on this task and performed as well as highly trained experts.

At the same time, it has become apparent that these formulations can be extended and deepened.The major purpose of this book is to review these developments and to propose a reformulation of the theory of transformational generative grammar that takes them into account.

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality :aword sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.},

abstract = {The categorical compositional approach to meaning has been successfully applied in natural language processing, outperforming other models in mainstream empirical language processing tasks. We show how this approach can be generalized to conceptual space models of cognition. In order to do this, first we introduce the category of convex relations as a new setting for categorical compositional semantics, emphasizing the convex structure important to conceptual space applications. We then show how to construct conceptual spaces for various types such as nouns, adjectives and verbs. Finally we show by means of examples how concepts can be systematically combined to establish the meanings of composite phrases from the meanings of their constituent parts. This provides the mathematical underpinnings of a new compositional approach to cognition.},

abstract = {Network theory uses the string diagrammatic language of monoidal categories to study graphical structures formally, eschewing specialised translations into intermediate formalisms. Recently, there has been a concerted research focus on developing a network theoretic approach to signal flow graphs, which are classical structures in control theory, signal processing and a cornerstone in the study of feedback. In this approach, signal flow graphs are given a relational denotational semantics in terms of formal power series. Thus far, the operational behaviour of such signal flow graphs has only been discussed at an intuitive level. In this paper we equip them with a structural operational semantics. As is typically the case, the purely operational picture is too concrete -- two graphs that are denotationally equal may exhibit different operational behaviour. We classify the ways in which this can occur and show that any graph can be realised -- rewritten, using the graphical theory, into an executable form where the operational behavior and the denotation coincides.},

abstract = {String diagrams are a powerful and intuitive graphical syntax for terms of symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs). They find many applications in computer science and are becoming increasingly relevant in other fields such as physics and control theory. An important role in many such approaches is played by equational theories of diagrams, typically oriented and applied as rewrite rules. This paper lays a comprehensive foundation of this form of rewriting. We interpret diagrams combinatorially as typed hypergraphs and establish the precise correspondence between diagram rewriting modulo the laws of SMCs on the one hand and double pushout (DPO) rewriting of hypergraphs, subject to a soundness condition called convexity, on the other. This result rests on a more general characterisation theorem in which we show that typed hypergraph DPO rewriting amounts to diagram rewriting modulo the laws of SMCs with a chosen special Frobenius structure. We illustrate our approach with a proof of termination for the theory of non-commutative bimonoids.},

Projective simulation is based on a random walk through a network of clips, which are elementary patches of episodic memory. The network of clips changes dynamically, both due to new perceptual input and due to certain compositional principles of the simulation process. During simulation, the clips are screened for specific features which trigger factual action of the agent. The scheme is different from other, computational, notions of simulation, and it provides a new element in an embodied cognitive science approach to intelligent action and learning. Our model provides a natural route for generalization to quantum-mechanical operation and connects the fields of reinforcement learning and quantum computation.},

abstract = {The security of most existing cryptocurrencies is based on a concept called Proof-of-Work, in which users must solve a computationally hard cryptopuzzle to authorize transactions (`one unit of computation, one vote'). This leads to enormous expenditure on hardware and electricity in order to collect the rewards associated with transaction authorization. Proof-of-Stake is an alternative concept that instead selects users to authorize transactions proportional to their wealth (`one coin, one vote'). Some aspects of the two paradigms are the same. For instance, obtaining voting power in Proof-of-Stake has a monetary cost just as in Proof-of-Work: a coin cannot be freely duplicated any more easily than a unit of computation. However some aspects are fundamentally different. In particular, exactly because Proof-of-Stake is wasteless, there is no inherent resource cost to deviating (commonly referred to as the `Nothing-at-Stake' problem). In contrast to prior work, we focus on incentive-driven deviations (any participant will deviate if doing so yields higher revenue) instead of adversarial corruption (an adversary may take over a significant fraction of the network, but the remaining players follow the protocol). The main results of this paper are several formal barriers to designing incentive-compatible proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies (that don't apply to proof-of-work).},

Two pictures are mutually homomorphic if and only if they represent equal allegorical terms.

We illustrate the use of pictures by deriving the ripple adder implementation from a high level, behavioural specification.},

In a recent paper, an algebra of stateless connectors was presented that consists of five kinds of basic connectors, namely symmetry, synchronization, mutual exclusion, hiding and inaction, plus their duals, and it was shown how they can be freely composed in series and in parallel to model sophisticated 'glues'. In this paper we explore the expressiveness of stateful connectors obtained by adding one-place buffers or unbounded buffers to the stateless connectors. The main results are: i) we show how different classes of connectors exactly correspond to suitable classes of Petri nets equipped with compositional interfaces, called nets with boundaries; ii) we show that the difference between strong and weak semantics in stateful connectors is reflected in the semantics of nets with boundaries by moving from the classic step semantics (strong case) to a novel banking semantics (weak case), where a step can be executed by taking some 'debit' tokens to be given back during the same step; iii) we show that the corresponding bisimilarities are congruences (w.r.t. composition of connectors in series and in parallel); iv) we show that suitable monoidality laws, like those arising when representing stateful connectors in the tile model, can nicely capture concurrency (in the sense of step semantics) aspects; and v) as a side result, we provide a basic algebra, with a finite set of symbols, out of which we can compose all P/T nets with boundaries, fulfilling a long standing quest.},

Budge spent all his free time learning and discovering Semitic languages, including Assyrian, Syriac, and Hebrew. Eventually, through a close contact, he was able to acquire a job working with Egyptian and Iraqi artifacts at the British Museum. Budge excavated and deciphered numerous cuneiform and hieroglyphic documents, contributing vastly to the museum's collection.

This text is not intended to be encyclopedic; rather, a few themes central to universal algebra have been developed sufficiently to bring the reader to the brink of current research. The choice of topics most certainly reflects the authors' interests. Chapter I contains a brief but substantial introduction to lattices, and to the close connection between complete lattices and closure operators. In particular, everything necessary for the subsequent study of congruence lattices is included. Chapter II develops the most general and fundamental notions of uni\- versal algebra-these include the results that apply to all types of algebras, such as the homomorphism and isomorphism theorems. Free algebras are discussed in great detail-we use them to derive the existence of simple algebras, the rules of equational logic, and the important Mal'cev conditions. We introduce the notion of classifying a variety by properties of (the lattices of) congruences on members of the variety. Also, the center of an algebra is defined and used to characterize modules (up to polynomial equivalence). In Chapter III we show how neatly two famous results-the refutation of Euler's conjecture on orthogonal Latin squares and Kleene's character\- ization of languages accepted by finite automata-can be presented using universal algebra. We predict that such "applied universal algebra" will become much more prominent.},

Commonly cited alternative applications of blockchain technology include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments ("colored coins"), the ownership of an underlying physical device ("smart property"), non-fungible assets such as domain names ("Namecoin"), as well as more complex applications involving having digital assets being directly controlled by a piece of code implementing arbitrary rules ("smart contracts") or even blockchain-based "decentralized autonomous organizations" (DAOs).

abstract = {We investigate several conceptions of linguistic structure to determine whether or not they can provide simple and "revealing" grammars that generate all of the sentences of English and only these. We find that no finite-state Markov process that produces symbols with transition from state to state can serve as an English grammar. Furthermore, the particular subclass of such processes that produce\textbackslash textlesstex\textbackslash textgreatern\textbackslash textless/tex\textbackslash textgreater-order statistical approximations to English do not come closer, with increasing\textbackslash textlesstex\textbackslash textgreatern\textbackslash textless/tex\textbackslash textgreater, to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the notions of "phrase structure" and show that this gives us a method for describing language which is essentially more powerful, though still representable as a rather elementary type of finite-state process. Nevertheless, it is successful only when limited to a small subset of simple sentences. We study the formal properties of a set of grammatical transformations that carry sentences with phrase structure into new sentences with derived phrase structure, showing that transformational grammars are processes of the same elementary type as phrase-structure grammars; that the grammar of English is materially simplified if phrase structure description is limited to a kernel of simple sentences from which all other sentences are constructed by repeated transformations; and that this view of linguistic structure gives a certain insight into the use and understanding of language.},

A key observation is that the monoidal category of (finite dimensional) vector spaces, linear maps and the tensor product, as well as any pregroup, are examples of compact closed categories. Since, by definition, a pregroup is a compact closed category with trivial morphisms, its compositional content is reflected within the compositional structure of any non-degenerate compact closed category. The (slightly refined) category of vector spaces enables us to compute the meaning of a compound well-typed sentence from the meaning of its constituents, by `lifting' the type reduction mechanisms of pregroup semantics to the whole category. These sentence meanings live in a single space, independent of the grammatical structure of the sentence. Hence we can use the inner-product to compare meanings of arbitrary sentences. A variation of this procedure which involves constraining the scalars of the vector spaces to the semiring of Booleans results in the well-known Montague semantics.},

Our main focus will be on monoidal categories, mostly symmetric ones, for which we propose a physical interpretation. These are particularly relevant for quantum foundations and for quantum informatics. Special attention is given to the category which has finite dimensional Hilbert spaces as objects, linear maps as morphisms, and the tensor product as its monoidal structure (FdHilb). We also provide a detailed discussion of the category which has sets as objects, relations as morphisms, and the cartesian product as its monoidal structure (Rel), and thirdly, categories with manifolds as objects and cobordisms between these as morphisms (2Cob). While sets, Hilbert spaces and manifolds do not share any non-trivial common structure, these three categories are in fact structurally very similar. Shared features are diagrammatic calculus, compact closed structure and particular kinds of internal comonoids which play an important role in each of them. The categories FdHilb and Rel moreover admit a categorical matrix calculus. Together these features guide us towards topological quantum field theories. We also discuss posetal categories, how group representations are in fact categorical constructs, and what strictification and coherence of monoidal categories is all about. In our attempt to complement the existing literature we omitted some very basic topics. For these we refer the reader to other available sources.},

abstract = {The Distributional Compositional Categorical (DisCoCat) model is a mathematical framework that provides compositional semantics for meanings of natural language sentences. It consists of a computational procedure for constructing meanings of sentences, given their grammatical structure in terms of compositional type-logic, and given the empirically derived meanings of their words. For the particular case that the meaning of words is modelled within a distributional vector space model, its experimental predictions, derived from real large scale data, have outperformed other empirically validated methods that could build vectors for a full sentence. This success can be attributed to a conceptually motivated mathematical underpinning, by integrating qualitative compositional type-logic and quantitative modelling of meaning within a category-theoretic mathematical framework. The type-logic used in the DisCoCat model is Lambek's pregroup grammar. Pregroup types form a posetal compact closed category, which can be passed, in a functorial manner, on to the compact closed structure of vector spaces, linear maps and tensor product. The diagrammatic versions of the equational reasoning in compact closed categories can be interpreted as the flow of word meanings within sentences. Pregroups simplify Lambek's previous type-logic, the Lambek calculus, which has been extensively used to formalise and reason about various linguistic phenomena. The apparent reliance of the DisCoCat on pregroups has been seen as a shortcoming. This paper addresses this concern, by pointing out that one may as well realise a functorial passage from the original type-logic of Lambek, a monoidal bi-closed category, to vector spaces, or to any other model of meaning organised within a monoidal bi-closed category. The corresponding string diagram calculus, due to Baez and Stay, now depicts the flow of word meanings.},

When addressing a new problem domain, such as conceptual space models of meaning, a key problem is finding a compact closed category that captures the features of interest.We propose categories of generalized relations as a source of new, practical models for cognition and NLP. We demonstrate using detailed examples that phenomena such as fuzziness, metrics, convexity, semantic ambiguity can all be described by relational models. Crucially, by exploiting a technical framework described in previous work of the authors, we also show how the above-mentioned phenomena can be combined into a single model, providing a flexible family of new categories for categorical compositional modelling.},

abstract = {Lexical-semantic resources, including thesauri and WORDNET, have been successfully incor- porated into a wide range of applications in Natural Language Processing. However they are very difficult and expensive to create and maintain, and their usefulness has been severely hampered by their limited coverage, bias and inconsistency. Automated and semi-automated methods for developing such resources are therefore crucial for further resource development and improved application performance. Systems that extract thesauri often identify similar words using the distributional hypothesis that similar words appear in similar contexts. This approach involves using corpora to examine the contexts each word appears in and then calculating the similarity between context distributions. Different definitions of context can be used, and I begin by examining how different types of extracted context influence similarity. To be of most benefit these systems must be capable of finding synonyms for rare words. Reliable context counts for rare events can only be extracted from vast collections of text. In this dissertation I describe how to extract contexts from a corpus of over 2 billion words. I describe techniques for processing text on this scale and examine the trade-off between context accuracy, information content and quantity of text analysed. Distributional similarity is at best an approximation to semantic similarity. I develop improved approximations motivated by the intuition that some events in the context distribution are more indicative of meaning than others. For instance, the object-of-verb context wear is far more indicative of a clothing noun than get. However, existing distributional techniques do not effectively utilise this information. The new context-weighted similarity metric I propose in this dissertation significantly outperforms every distributional similarity metric described in the literature. Nearest-neighbour similarity algorithms scale poorly with vocabulary and context vector size. To overcome this problem I introduce a new context-weighted approximation algorithm with bounded complexity in context vector size that significantly reduces the system runtime with only a minor performance penalty. I also describe a parallelized version of the system that runs on a Beowulf cluster for the 2 billion word experiments. To evaluate the context-weighted similarity measure I compare ranked similarity lists against gold-standard resources using precision and recall-based measures from Information Retrieval, since the alternative, application-based evaluation, can often be influenced by distributional as well as semantic similarity. I also perform a detailed analysis of the final results using WORDNET. Finally, I apply my similarity metric to the task of assigning words to WORDNET semantic categories. I demonstrate that this new approach outperforms existing methods and overcomes some of their weaknesses.},

abstract = {Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) mediate almost all of our interactions with computers, whether it is through web pages, phone apps, or desktop applications. Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a promising approach to GUI design. This thesis presents Elm, a concurrent FRP language focused on easily creating responsive GUIs. Elm has two major features: (1) purely functional graphical layout and (2) support for Concurrent FRP. Purely functional graphical layout is a high level framework for working with complex visual com- ponents. It makes it quick and easy to create and combine text, images, and video into rich multimedia displays. Concurrent FRP solves some of FRP's long-standing efficiency problems: global delays and needless recomputation. Together, Elm's two major features simplify the complicated task of creating responsive and usable graphical user interfaces. This thesis also includes a fully functional compiler for Elm, available at elm-lang.org. This site includes an interactive code editor that allows you to write and compile Elm programs online with no download or install.},

This allows us to produce conjugacy between dynamical systems out of combinatorial data. In particular we show that surjective graph fibrations lead to synchrony subspaces in networks. The injective graph fibrations, on the other hand, give rise to surjective maps from large dynamical systems to smaller ones. One can view these surjections as a kind of "fast/slow" variable decompositions or as "abstractions" in the computer science sense of the word.},

abstract = {Despite large incentives, ecorrectness in software remains an elusive goal. Declarative programming techniques, where algorithms are derived from a specification of the desired behavior, offer hope to address this problem, since there is a combinatorial reduction in complexity in programming in terms of specifications instead of algorithms, and arbitrary desired properties can be expressed and enforced in specifications directly. However, limitations on performance have prevented programming with declarative specifications from becoming a mainstream technique for general-purpose programming. To address the performance bottleneck in deriving an algorithm from a specification, I propose information-gain computation, a framework where an adaptive evaluation strategy is used to efficiently perform a search which derives algorithms that provide information about a query most directly. Within this framework, opportunities to compress the search space present themselves, which suggest that information-theoretic bounds on the performance of such a system might be articulated and a system designed to achieve them. In a preliminary empirical study of adaptive evaluation for a simple test program, the evaluation strategy adapts successfully to evaluate a query efficiently.},

The mix of constructs found in BPMN makes it possible to create models with semantic errors. Such errors are especially serious, because errors in the early phases of systems development are among the most costly and hardest to correct. The ability to statically check the semantic correctness of models is thus a desirable feature for modelling tools based on BPMN. Accordingly, this paper proposes a mapping from BPMN to a formal language, namely Petri nets, for which efficient analysis techniques are available. The proposed mapping has been implemented as a tool that, in conjunction with existing Petri net-based tools, enables the static analysis of BPMN models. The formalisation also led to the identification of deficiencies in the BPMN standard specification.},

It explores questions of expressiveness and completeness of linear logic with respect to this interpretation. An aim is to use Petri nets to give an understanding of linear logic and give some appraisal of the value of linear logic as a specification logic for Petri nets. This article might serve as a tutorial, providing one in-road into Girard's linear logic via Petri nets. With this in mind we have added several exercises and their solutions. We have made no attempt to be exhaustive in our treatment, dedicating our treatment to one semantics of intuitionistic linear logic. Completeness is shown for several versions of Girard's linear logic with respect to Petri nets as the class of models. The strongest logic considered is intuitionistic linear logic, with {$\otimes$}, {$\multimap$}, \&, {$\oplus$} and the exponential ! (``of course''), and forms of quantification. This logic is shown sound and complete with respect to atomic nets (these include nets in which every transition leads to a nonempty multiset of places). The logic is remarkably expressive, enabling descriptions of the kinds of properties one might wish to show of nets; in particular, negative properties, asserting the impossibility of an assertion, can also be expressed. A start is made on decidability issues.},

abstract = {Control theory uses `signal-flow diagrams' to describe processes where real-valued functions of time are added, multiplied by scalars, differentiated and integrated, duplicated and deleted. These diagrams can be seen as string diagrams for the PROP FinRel\_k, the strict version of the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over the field of rational functions k = R(s) and linear relations, where the variable s acts as differentiation and the monoidal structure is direct sum rather than the usual tensor product of vector spaces. Control processes are also described by controllability and observability---whether the input can drive the process to any state, and whether any state can be determined from later outputs. For any field k we give a presentation of FinRel\_k in terms of generators of the free PROP of signal-flow diagrams together with the equations that give FinRel\_k its structure. The `cap' and `cup' generators, missing when the morphisms are linear maps, make it possible to model feedback. The relations say, among other things, that the 1-dimensional vector space k has two special commutative dagger-Frobenius structures, such that the multiplication and unit of either one and the comultiplication and counit of the other fit together to form a bimonoid. This sort of structure, but with tensor product replacing direct sum, is familiar from the `ZX-calculus' obeyed by a finite-dimensional Hilbert space with two mutually unbiased bases. In order to address controllability and observability, we construct the PROP Stateful\_k and relate it back to the PROP of signal-flow diagrams. This provides a way to graphically express controllability and observability for linear time-invariant processes.},

abstract = {Analytical Mechanics is the investigation of motion with the rigorous tools of mathematics. Rooted in the works of Lagrange, Euler, Poincar\'e (to mention just a few), it is a very classical subject with fascinating developments and still rich of open problems. It addresses such fundamental questions as: Is the solar system stable? Is there a unifying 'economy' principle in mechanics? How can a point mass be described as a 'wave'? And has remarkable applications to many branches of physics (Astronomy, Statistical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics). This book was written to fill a gap between elementary expositions and more advanced (and clearly more stimulating) material. It takes up the challenge to explain the most relevant ideas (generally highly non-trivial) and to show the most important applications using a plain language and 'simple' mathematics, often through an original approach. Basic calculus is enough for the reader to proceed through the book. New mathematical concepts are fully introduced and illustrated in a simple, student-friendly language. More advanced chapters can be omitted while still following the main ideas. Anybody wishing to go deeper in some direction will find at least the flavour of recent developments and many bibliographical references. The theory is always accompanied by examples. Many problems are suggested and some are completely worked out at the end of each chapter.

The objects of these categories, our so-called `decorated cospan categories', are simply the objects of \$\textbackslash mathcal C\$, while the morphisms are pairs comprising a cospan \$X \textbackslash rightarrow N \textbackslash leftarrow Y\$ in \$\textbackslash mathcal C\$ together with an element \$1 \textbackslash to FN\$ in \$\textbackslash mathcal D\$.

abstract = {Herein we develop category-theoretic tools for understanding network-style diagrammatic languages. The archetypal network-style diagrammatic language is that of electric circuits; other examples include signal flow graphs, Markov processes, automata, Petri nets, chemical reaction networks, and so on. The key feature is that the language is comprised of a number of components with multiple (input/output) terminals, each possibly labelled with some type, that may then be connected together along these terminals to form a larger network. The components form hyperedges between labelled vertices, and so a diagram in this language forms a hypergraph. We formalise the compositional structure by introducing the notion of a hypergraph category. Network-style diagrammatic languages and their semantics thus form hypergraph categories, and semantic interpretation gives a hypergraph functor. The first part of this thesis develops the theory of hypergraph categories. In particular, we introduce the tools of decorated cospans and corelations. Decorated cospans allow straightforward construction of hypergraph categories from diagrammatic languages: the inputs, outputs, and their composition are modelled by the cospans, while the 'decorations' specify the components themselves. Not all hypergraph categories can be constructed, however, through decorated cospans. Decorated corelations are a more powerful version that permits construction of all hypergraph categories and hypergraph functors. These are often useful for constructing the semantic categories of diagrammatic languages and functors from diagrams to the semantics. To illustrate these principles, the second part of this thesis details applications to linear time-invariant dynamical systems and passive linear networks.},

We define this formally and say that \$\textbackslash mathcal\{C\}\$ supplies the algebraic structure. For example, the category \$\textbackslash mathsf\{Rel\}\$ of relations between sets has monoidal structures given by both cartesian product and disjoint union, and with respect to either one it supplies comonoids. We prove several facts about the notion of supply, e.g. that the associators, unitors, and braiding of \$\textbackslash mathcal\{C\}\$ are automatically homomorphisms for any supply, as are the coherence isomorphisms for any strong symmetric monoidal functor that preserve supplies. We also show that any supply of structure in a symmetric monoidal category can be extended to a supply of that structure on its strictification.},

Science 306, 496-499]. We show that the Pirah\~a have no linguistic method whatsoever for expressing exact quantity, not even "one." Despite this lack, when retested on the matching tasks used by Gordon, Pirah\~a speakers were able to perform exact matches with large numbers of objects perfectly but, as previously reported, they were inaccurate on matching tasks involving memory. These results suggest that language for exact number is a cultural invention rather than a linguistic universal, and that number words do not change our underlying representations of number but instead are a cognitive technology for keeping track of the cardinality of large sets across time, space, and changes in modality. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The compositional distributional account models meaning of sentences relying on their grammatical structure to guide semantic composition. It has been successfully applied to the theory of conceptual spaces for cognition in [7], using convex algebras that describe the important convex structure of natural concepts. In the literature, metric spaces are also widely used to characterise conceptual spaces, however, they do not have the necessary structure as a category, compact closedness, to fit into the compositional distributional account. There are several alternatives to build a compact closed category from a given one and, in particular, this dissertation investigates the so-called span construction. Various interpretations and applications, including those in the cognition and linguistics setting, are analysed for spans of sets and metric spaces. A model for path composition is first explored to introduce the most important characteristics of this construction. Later, an interpretation for cognition to describe hyper-conceptual spaces results in applications for the phenomena of categorical perception or concept correlation. As a side effect, a connection with algebra of bags is explored and an enrichment over commutative monoids for span categories arises from this setting. To conclude, it is found that spans of metric spaces are suitable to model several aspects in cognitive science and they have applications in other areas such as algebra of bags.},

CycleGAN is a general approach to unpaired image-to-image translation that has been getting attention in the recent years. Inspired by categorical database systems, we show that CycleGAN is a "schema", i.e.\@\xspace a specific category presented by generators and relations, whose specific parameter instantiations are just set-valued functors on this schema. We show that enforcing cycle-consistencies amounts to enforcing composition invariants in this category. We generalize the learning procedure to arbitrary such categories and show a special class of functors, rather than functions, can be learned using gradient descent. Using this framework we design a novel neural network system capable of learning to insert and delete objects from images without paired data. We qualitatively evaluate the system on the CelebA dataset and obtain promising results.},

abstract = {We introduce open games as a compositional foundation of economic game theory. A compositional approach potentially allows methods of game theory and theoretical computer science to be applied to large-scale economic models for which standard economic tools are not practical. An open game represents a game played relative to an arbitrary environment and to this end we introduce the concept of coutility, which is the utility generated by an open game and returned to its environment. Open games are the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal category and can therefore be composed by categorical composition into sequential move games and by monoidal products into simultaneous move games. Open games can be represented by string diagrams which provide an intuitive but formal visualisation of the information flows. We show that a variety of games can be faithfully represented as open games in the sense of having the same Nash equilibria and off-equilibrium best responses.},

abstract = {We introduce a general diagrammatic theory of digital circuits, based on connections between monoidal categories and graph rewriting. The main achievement of the paper is conceptual, filling a foundational gap in reasoning syntactically and symbolically about a large class of digital circuits (discrete values, discrete delays, feedback). This complements the dominant approach to circuit modelling, which relies on simulation. The main advantage of our symbolic approach is the enabling of automated reasoning about abstract circuits, with a potentially interesting new application to partial evaluation of digital circuits. Relative to the recent interest and activity in categorical and diagrammatic methods, our work makes several new contributions. The most important is establishing that categories of digital circuits are Cartesian and admit, in the presence of feedback expressive iteration axioms. The second is producing a general yet simple graph-rewrite framework for reasoning about such categories in which the rewrite rules are computationally efficient, opening the way for practical applications.},

abstract = {Its finally here! In the fifth volume of the acclaimed Card College series, Roberto Giobbi has prepared a graduation party! In previous volumes the reader has been given a remarkable collection of tools for creating astonishing card magic. In the same vein, Volume 5 begins with a meaty chapter of new techniques and strategies, which include methods for covertly arranging stacks during performance, obtaining a duplicate of a spectators signature with his knowledge, and secretly conveying cards to and from the deck. Powerful tools indeed. But then Volume 5 diverges from the established Card College formula. Judging that the reader now has more than a sufficient number of tools in his grasp, Mr. Giobbi provides eight chapters filled with tricks and routines that illustrate how various techniques are applied to create world-class card magic. These effects, however, are not mere constructions meant for teaching. Most have been drawn from Roberto Giobbis professional repertoire and because of this even the classics of card magic are given a fresh gleam as Giobbi adds refinements won from years of performing experience. His choice of material is impeccable, featuring not only original effects and handlings of his own, but tricks and routines by world-masters as well. One finds such gems as Fred Kaps presentation for The Signed Card in Box, along with Giobbi's cunning treatment of this modern classic, Henry Christs fabulous Ace routine and a superb handling of a forgotten masterpiece by Charlie Miller. And everything is taught with the clarity and attention to detail for which the Card College series has become known. Open this book and welcome to the party - prepare to graduate!

The models obtained with our construction possess many of the familiar structures used in Categorical Quantum Mechanics. We also provide a bestiary of increasingly exotic examples: some well known, such as real quantum theory and relational quantum theory; some less known, such as hyperbolic quantum theory, p-adic quantum theory and "parity quantum theory"; and some entirely new, such as "finite-field quantum theory" and "tropical quantum theory". As a further bonus, the measurement scenarios arising within these theories can be studied using the sheaf-theoretic framework for non-locality and contextuality. Their computational complexity can similarly be studied within existing frameworks for affine and unitary circuits over commutative semirings.},

KURT GODEL This book is a compilation and development of lecture notes written for a course on nonstandard analysis that I have now taught several times. Students taking the course have typically received previous introductions to standard real analysis and abstract algebra, but few have studied formal logic. Most of the notes have been used several times in class and revised in the light of that experience. The earlier chapters could be used as the basis of a course at the upper undergraduate level, but the work as a whole, including the later applications, may be more suited to a beginning graduate course. This prefacedescribes my motivationsand objectives in writingthe book. For the most part, these remarks are addressed to the potential instructor. Mathematical understanding develops by a mysterious interplay between intuitive insight and symbolic manipulation. Nonstandard analysis requires an enhanced sensitivity to the particular symbolic form that is used to ex\- press our intuitions, and so the subject poses some unique and challenging pedagogical issues. The most fundamental ofthese is how to turn the trans\- fer principle into a working tool of mathematical practice. I have found it vi Preface unproductive to try to give a proof of this principle by introducing the formal Tarskian semantics for first-order languages and working through the proofofLos's theorem.},

The book also introduces the often-intimidating machinery of roots and the Weyl group in a gradual way, using examples and representation theory as motivation. The text is divided into two parts. The first covers Lie groups and Lie algebras and the relationship between them, along with basic representation theory. The second part covers the theory of semisimple Lie groups and Lie algebras, beginning with a detailed analysis of the representations of SU(3). The author illustrates the general theory with numerous images pertaining to Lie algebras of rank two and rank three, including images of root systems, lattices of dominant integral weights, and weight diagrams.

We suggest how current developments in linguistics can be profitably wedded to work in evolutionary biology, anthropology, psychology, and neuroscience. We submit that a distinction should be made between the faculty of language in the broad sense (FLB) and in the narrow sense (FLN). FLB includes a sensory-motor system, a conceptual-intentional system, and the computational mechanisms for recursion, providing the capacity to generate an infinite range of expressions from a finite set of elements. We hypothesize that FLN only includes recursion and is the only uniquely human component of the faculty of language. We further argue that FLN may have evolved for reasons other than language, hence comparative studies might look for evidence of such computations outside of the domain of communication (for example, number, navigation, and social relations).},

title = {Towards {{Compositional Game Theory}}},
author = {Hedges, Julian},

institution = {{Queen Mary University of London}},
abstract = {We introduce a new foundation for game theory based on so-called open games. Unlike existing approaches open games are fully compositional: games are built using algebraic operations from standard components, such as players and outcome functions, with no fundamental distinction being made between the parts and the whole. Open games are intended to be applied at large scales where classical game theory becomes impractical to use, and this thesis therefore covers part of the theoretical foundation of a powerful new tool for economics and other subjects using game theory. Formally we define a symmetric monoidal category whose morphisms are open games, which can therefore be combined either sequentially using categorical composition, or simultaneously using the monoidal product. Using this structure we can also graphically represent open games using string diagrams. We prove that the new definitions give the same results (both equilibria and off-equilibrium best responses) as classical game theory in several important special cases: normal form games with pure and mixed strategy Nash equilibria, and perfect information games with subgame perfect equilibria. This thesis also includes work on higher order game theory, a related but simpler approach to game theory that uses higher order functions to model players. This has been extensively developed by Martin Escard\textasciiacute{} o and Paulo Oliva for games of perfect information, and we extend it to normal form games. We show that this approach can be used to elegantly model coordination and differentiation goals of players. We also argue that a modification of the solution concept used by Escard\textasciiacute{} o and Oliva is more appropriate for such applications.},

abstract = {An atomic cross-chain swap is a distributed coordination task where multiple parties exchange assets across multiple blockchains, for example, trading bitcoin for ether. An atomic swap protocol guarantees (1) if all parties conform to the protocol, then all swaps take place, (2) if some coalition deviates from the protocol, then no conforming party ends up worse off, and (3) no coalition has an incentive to deviate from the protocol. A cross-chain swap is modeled as a directed graph \$\{\textbackslash cal D\}\$, whose vertexes are parties and whose arcs are proposed asset transfers. For any pair \$(\{\textbackslash cal D\},L)\$, where \$\{\textbackslash cal D\} = (V,A)\$ is a strongly-connected directed graph and \$L \textbackslash subset V\$ a feedback vertex set for \$\{\textbackslash cal D\}\$, we give an atomic cross-chain swap protocol for \$\{\textbackslash cal D\}\$, using a form of hashed timelock contracts, where the vertexes in \$L\$ generate the hashlocked secrets. We show that no such protocol is possible if \$\{\textbackslash cal D\}\$ is not strongly connected, or if \$\{\textbackslash cal D\}\$ is strongly connected but \$L\$ is not a feedback vertex set. The protocol has time complexity \$O(diam(\{\textbackslash cal D\}))\$ and space complexity (bits stored on all blockchains) \$O(|A|\^2)\$.},

In particular, we are interested in deducing where information flow (communication or otherwise) has taken place, and fully accounting for all possible paths. The core mathematical concept is using a single categorical diagram to model the underlying mathematics, the epistemic knowledge of the participants, and (implicitly) the potential or actual communication between participants. A key part of this is a `correctness' or `consistency' criterion that ensures we accurately \& fully account for the distinct routes by which information may come to be known (i.e.\@\xspace communication and / or calculation). We demonstrate how this formalism may be applied to answer questions about communication scenarios where we have the partial information about the participants and their interactions. Similarly, we show how to analyse the consequences of changes to protocols or communications, and to enumerate the distinct orders in which events may have occurred. We use various forms of Diffie-Hellman key exchange as an illustration of these techniques. However, they are entirely general; we illustrate in an appendix how other protocols from non-commutative cryptography may be analysed in the same manner.},

Hence, equipped with a quantale V (replacing the reals) and a monad T (replacing the ultrafilter monad) laxly extended from set maps to V-valued relations, the book develops a categorical theory of (T,V)-algebras that is inspired simultaneously by its metric and topological roots. The book highlights in particular the distinguished role of equationally defined structures within the given lax-algebraic context and presents numerous new results ranging from topology and approach theory to domain theory.

abstract = {Osherson and Smith (1981, Cognition, 11, 237-262) discuss a number of problems which arise for a prototype-based account of the meanings of simple and complex concepts. Assuming that concept combination in such a theory is to be analyzed in terms of fuzzy logic, they show that some complex concepts inevitably get assigned the wrong meanings. In the present paper we argue that many of the problems O\&S discovered are due to difficulties that are intrinsic to fuzzy set theory, and that most of them disappear when fuzzy logic is replaced by supervaluation theory. However, even after this replacement one of O\&S's central problems remains: the theory still predicts that the degree to which an object is an instance of, say, "striped apple" must be less than or equal to both the degree to which it is an instance of "striped" and the degree to which it is an instance of "apple", but this constraint conflicts with O\&S's experimental results. The second part of the paper explores ways of solving this and related problems. This leads us to suggest a number of distinctions and principles concerning how prototypicality and other mechanisms interact and which seem important for semantics generally. Prominent among these are (i) the distinction between on the one hand the logical and semantic properties of concepts and on the other the linguistic that between concepts for which the extension is determined by their prototype and concepts for which extension and prototypicality are independent. ?? 1995.},

They also provide semantics for Lambek's pregroup algebras, applied to formalizing the grammatical structure of natural language, and are implicit in a distributional model of word meaning based on vector spaces. Specifically, in previous work Coecke-Clark-Sadrzadeh used the product category of pregroups with vector spaces and provided a distributional model of meaning for sentences. We recast this theory in terms of strongly monoidal functors and advance it via Frobenius algebras over vector spaces. The former are used to formalize topological quantum field theories by Atiyah and Baez-Dolan, and the latter are used to model classical data in quantum protocols by Coecke-Pavlovic-Vicary. The Frobenius algebras enable us to work in a single space in which meanings of words, phrases, and sentences of any structure live. Hence we can compare meanings of different language constructs and enhance the applicability of the theory. We report on experimental results on a number of language tasks and verify the theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {Modern processors use branch prediction and speculative execution to maximize performance. For example, if the destination of a branch depends on a memory value that is in the process of being read, CPUs will try guess the destination and attempt to execute ahead. When the memory value finally arrives, the CPU either discards or commits the speculative computation. Speculative logic is unfaithful in how it executes, can access to the victim's memory and registers, and can perform operations with measurable side effects. Spectre attacks involve inducing a victim to speculatively perform operations that would not occur during correct program execution and which leak the victim's confidential information via a side channel to the adversary. This paper describes practical attacks that combine methodology from side channel attacks, fault attacks, and return-oriented programming that can read arbitrary memory from the victim's process. More broadly, the paper shows that speculative execution implementations violate the security assumptions underpinning numerous software security mechanisms, including operating system process separation, static analysis, containerization, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, and countermeasures to cache timing/side-channel attacks. These attacks represent a serious threat to actual systems, since vulnerable speculative execution capabilities are found in microprocessors from Intel, AMD, and ARM that are used in billions of devices. While makeshift processor-specific countermeasures are possible in some cases, sound solutions will require fixes to processor designs as well as updates to instruction set architectures (ISAs) to give hardware architects and software developers a common understanding as to what computation state CPU implementations are (and are not) permitted to leak.},

abstract = {This contribution presents recent results on Elementary Object Systems (EOS). Object nets are Petri nets which have Petri nets as tokens \&ndash; an approach known as the nets-within-nets paradigm. In this work we study the relationship of EOS to existing Petri net formalisms. It turns out that EOS are equivalent to counter programs. But even for the restricted subclass of conservative EOS reachability and liveness are undecidable problems. On the other hand for other properties like boundedness are still decidable for conservative EOS. We also study the sub-class of generalised state machines, which is worth mentioning since it combines decidability of many theoretically interesting properties with a quite rich practical modelling expressiveness.},

abstract = {The prevalence of IoT devices makes them an ideal target for attackers. To reduce the risk of attacks vendors routinely deliver security updates (patches) for their devices. The delivery of security updates becomes challenging due to the issue of scalability as the number of devices may grow much quicker than vendors' distribution systems. Previous studies have suggested a permissionless and decentralized blockchain-based network in which nodes can host and deliver security updates, thus the addition of new nodes scales out the network. However, these studies do not provide an incentive for nodes to join the network, making it unlikely for nodes to freely contribute their hosting space, bandwidth, and computation resources. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized IoT software update delivery network in which participating nodes referred to as distributors) are compensated by vendors with digital currency for delivering updates to devices. Upon the release of a new security update, a vendor will make a commitment to provide digital currency to distributors that deliver the update; the commitment will be made with the use of smart contracts, and hence will be public, binding, and irreversible. The smart contract promises compensation to any distributor that provides proof-of-distribution, which is unforgeable proof that a single update was delivered to a single device. A distributor acquires the proof-of-distribution by exchanging a security update for a device signature using the Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment (ZKCP) trustless data exchange protocol. Eliminating the need for trust between the security update distributor and the security consumer (IoT device) by providing fair compensation, can significantly increase the number of distributors, thus facilitating rapid scale out.},

Much confusion has arisen in the past through a neglect of the develop ment of Leibniz's ideas, and Couturat's impressive plea, in his edition of the Opuscu/es et fragments (p. xii), for such an arrangement is valid even for incomplete editions. The beginning student will do well, however, to read the maturer writings of Parts II, III, and IV first, leaving Part I, from a period too largely neglected by Leibniz criticism, for a later study of the still obscure sources and motives of his thought. The Introduction aims primarily to provide cultural orientation and an exposition of the structure and the underlying assumptions of the philosophical system rather than a critical evaluation. I hope that together with the notes and the Index, it will provide those aids to the understanding which the originality of Leibniz's scientific, ethical, and metaphysical efforts deserve.},

This book develops some of the interactions between universal algebra and category theory as well as some of the resulting applications. We begin with an exposition of equationally defineable classes from the point of view of "algebraic theories", but without the use of category theory. This serves to motivate the general treatment of algebraic theories in a category, which is the central concern of the book. (No category theory is presumed; rather, an independent treatment is provided by the second chap\- ter.) Applications abound throughout the text and exercises and in the final chapter in which we pursue problems originating in topological dynamics and in automata theory. This book is a natural outgrowth of the ideas of a small group of mathematicians, many of whom were in residence at the Forschungsinstitut f\"ur Mathematik of the Eidgen\"ossische Technische Hochschule in Z\"urich, Switzerland during the academic year 1966-67. It was in this stimulating atmosphere that the author wrote his doctoral dissertation. The "Z\"urich School," then, was Michael Barr, Jon Beck, John Gray, Bill Lawvere, Fred Linton, and Myles Tierney (who were there) and (at least) Harry Appelgate, Sammy Eilenberg, John Isbell, and Saunders Mac Lane (whose spiritual presence was tangible).

abstract = {Mixed states are of interest in quantum mechanics for modelling partial information. More recently categorical approaches to linguistics have also exploited the idea of mixed states to describe ambiguity and hyponym / hypernym relationships. In both these application areas the category Rel of sets and binary relations is often used as an alternative model. Selinger's CPM construction provides the setting for mixed states in Hilbert space based categorical quantum mechanics. By analogy, applying the CPM construction to Rel is seen as introducing mixing into a relational setting. We investigate the category CPM(Rel) of completely positive maps in Rel. We show that the states of an object in CPM(Rel) are in bijective correspondence with certain families of graphs. Via map-state duality this then allows us provide a graph theoretic characterization of the morphisms in CPM(Rel). By identifying an appropriate composition operation on graphs, we then show that CPM(Rel) is isomorphic to a category of sets and graphs between them. This isomorphism then leads to a graph based description of the complete join semilattice enriched dagger compact structure of CPM(Rel). These results allow us to reason about CPM(Rel) entirely in terms of graphs. We exploit these techniques in several examples. We give a closed form expression for the number of states of a finite set in CPM(Rel). The pure states are characterized in graph theoretic terms. We also demonstrate the possibly surprising phenomenon of a pure state that can be given as a mixture of two mixed states.},

When investigating a new application, the question arises of how to identify a suitable process theoretic model. We present a conceptually motivated parameterized framework for the construction of models for process theories. Our framework generalizes the notion of binary relation along four axes of variation, the truth values, a choice of algebraic structure, the ambient mathematical universe and the choice of proof relevance or provability. The resulting categories are preorder-enriched and provide analogues of relational converse and taking graphs of maps. Our constructions are functorial in the parameter choices, establishing mathematical connections between different application domains. We illustrate our techniques by constructing many existing models from the literature, and new models that open up ground for further development.},

abstract = {The adoption of blockchain-based distributed computation platforms is growing fast. Some of these platforms, such as Ethereum, provide support for implementing smart contracts, which are envisioned to have novel applications in a broad range of areas, including finance and Internet-of-Things. However, a significant number of smart contracts deployed in practice suffer from security vulnerabilities, which enable malicious users to steal assets from a contract or to cause damage. Vulnerabilities present a serious issue since contracts may handle financial assets of considerable value, and contract bugs are non-fixable by design. To help developers create more secure smart contracts, we introduce FSolidM, a framework rooted in rigorous semantics for designing con- tracts as Finite State Machines (FSM). We present a tool for creating FSM on an easy-to-use graphical interface and for automatically generating Ethereum contracts. Further, we introduce a set of design patterns, which we implement as plugins that developers can easily add to their contracts to enhance security and functionality.},

Communication between the two families is implemented in terms of linear distributivity principles. The aim of this paper is to complement the symmetry between (dual) residuated type-forming operations with an orthogonal opposition that contrasts residuated and Galois connected operations. Whereas the (dual) residuated operations are monotone, the Galois connected operations (and their duals) are antitone. We discuss the algebraic properties of the (dual) Galois connected operations, and generalize the (co)product distributivity principles to include the negative operations. We give a continuation-passing-style translation for the new type-forming operations, and discuss some linguistic applications.},

A marked trend, in general, is the move to leaner syntactic calculi, by exchanging structural rules for richer algebraic models, or by introducing more structure in the interpreting semantic calculi. The excerpt taken from 1997 edition retains the core materials of the chapter: the discussion of the "classical" Lambek systems, the Curry-Howard perspective on the syntax-semantics interface, and the development of multimodal architectures. The central objective of the type-logical approach is to develop a uniform deductive account of the composition of form and meaning in natural language: Formal grammar is presented as logic-a system for reasoning about structured linguistic resources. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The approach embraces the trends of lexicalism and compositional semantics in computational linguistics, and theoretical linguistics more broadly, by developing categorial grammar into a powerful and extendable logic of signs. Taking Montague Grammar as its point of departure, the book explains how integration of methods from philosophy (logical semantics), computer science (type theory), linguistics (categorial grammar) and meta-mathematics (mathematical logic ) provides a categorial foundation with coverage including intensionality, quantification, featural polymorphism, domains and constraints. For the first time, the book systematises categorial thinking into a unified program which is at once both logically secured, and a practical tool for pure lexical grammar development with type-theoretic semantics. It should be of interest to all those active in computational linguistics and formal grammar and is suitable for use at advanced undergraduate, postgraduate, and research levels.},

Glyn Morrill opens with the history and notation of Lambek Calculus and its application to syntax, semantics, and processing. Successive chapters extend the grammar to a number of significant syntactic and semantic properties of natural language. The final part applies Morrill's account to several current issues in processing and parsing, considered from both a psychological and a computational perspective. The book offers a rigorous and thoughtful study of one of the main lines of research in the formal and mathematical theory of grammar, and will be suitable for students of linguistics and cognitive science from advanced undergraduate level upwards.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

We argue against each of these claims. Relying on the available documentation and descriptions of the language, especially the rich material in Everett 1986, 1987b, we argue that many of the exceptional grammatical 'gaps' supposedly characteristic of Pirah\~a are misanalyzed by Everett (2005) and are neither gaps nor exceptional among the world's languages. We find no evidence, for example, that Pirah\~a lacks embedded clauses, and in fact find strong syntactic and semantic evidence in favor of their existence in Pirah\~a Likewise, we find no evidence that Pirah\~a lacks quantifiers, as claimed by Everett (2005). Furthermore, most of the actual properties of the Pirah\~a constructions discussed by Everett (for example, the ban on prenominal possessor recursion and the behavior of WH -constructions) are familiar from languages whose speakers lack the cultural restrictions attributed to the Pirah\~a. Finally, following mostly Gon\c{c}alves (1993, 2000, 2001), we also question some of the empirical claims about Pirah\~a culture advanced by Everett in primary support of the 'immediate experience' restriction. We conclude that there is no evidence from Pirah\~a for the particular causal relation between culture and grammatical structure suggested by Everett.},

We study the applicability of multiparty session type (MPST) protocols for verification of actor programs. We incorporate sessions to actors by introducing minimum additions to the model such as the notion of actor roles and protocol mailboxes. The framework uses Scribble, which is a protocol description language based on multiparty session types. Our programming model supports actor-like syntax and runtime verification mechanism guaranteeing communication safety of the participating entities. An actor can implement multiple roles in a similar way as an object can implement multiple interfaces. Multiple roles allow for cooperative inter-concurrency in a single actor. We demonstrate our framework by designing and implementing a session actor library in Python and its runtime verification mechanism. Benchmark results demonstrate that the runtime checks induce negligible overhead. We evaluate the applicability of our verification framework to specify actor interactions by implementing twelve examples from an actor benchmark suit.},

Let's refer to the classifier object of \$E\$ as \$\textbackslash Omega\$, and to its Heyting Algebra of truth-values, \$Sub(1\_E)\$, as \$H\$; we will sometimes call \$H\$ the "logic" of the topos. There is a well-known way of representing notions of sheafness as morphisms \$j:\textbackslash Omega\textbackslash to \textbackslash Omega\$, but these `\$j\$'s yield big diagrams when we draw them explicitly; here we will see a way to represent these `\$j\$'s as maps \$J:H\textbackslash to H\$ in a way that is much more manageable. In the previous paper of this series we showed how certain toy models of Heyting Algebras, called "ZHAs", can be used to develop visual intuition for how Heyting Algebras and Intuitionistic Propositional Logic work; here we will extend that to sheaves. The full idea is this: notions of sheafness correspond to local operators and vice-versa; local operators correspond to J-operators and vice-versa; if our Heyting Algebra \$H\$ is a ZHA then J-operators correspond to slashings on \$H\$, and vice-versa; slashings on \$H\$ correspond to "sets of question marks" and vice-versa, and each set of question marks induces a notion of erasing and reconstructing, which induces a sheaf. Also, every ZHA \$H\$ corresponds to an (acyclic) 2-column graph, and vice-versa, and for any two-column graph \$(P,A)\$ the logic of the topos \$\textbackslash mathbf\{Set\}\^\{(P,A)\}\$ is exactly the ZHA \$H\$ associated to \$(P,A)\$.},

The Bit Ma- chine is used as a tool for measuring the computational space and time resources needed to evaluate Simplicity programs. Owing to its Turing incompleteness, Simplicity is amenable to static analysis that can be used to derive upper bounds on the computational resources needed, prior to execution.

The new classes are based on lemmata such as "every graph has an even number of odd-degree nodes." They contain several important problems for which no polynomial time algorithm is presently known, including the computational versions of Sperner's lemma, Brouwer's fixpoint theorem, Chevalley's theorem, and the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, the linear complementarity problem for P-matrices, finding a mixed equilibrium in a non-zero sum game, finding a second Hamilton circuit in a Hamiltonian cubic graph, a second Hamiltonian decomposition in a quartic graph, and others. Some of these problems are shown to be complete.},

abstract = {This chapter highlights the historical development of Montague grammar as both narrowly and broadly construed, with particular attention to the key ideas that led Montague's work to have such a great impact on subsequent developments. Contemporary formal semantics has roots in several disciplines, most importantly logic, philosophy, and linguistics. The central figure in its recent history was Richard Montague, a logician and philosopher whose seminal works in this area date from the late 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s. But Montague's work did not occur in a vacuum, and the development of "Montague grammar" and of formal semantics more generally, has involved contributions from many sources before, during, and after Montague's work. The paper of Montague that had the most impact on linguists and on the subsequent development of formal semantics in general, was PTQ: 24 pages long, but densely packed. To many, "Montague Grammar" has probably meant what Montague did in the fragment in PTQ and the extensions of PTQ by subsequent linguists and philosophers with greater and lesser innovations, but it is the broader algebraic framework of "Universal Grammar" (UG) that constitutes Montague's theory of grammar. Montague's paper "Universal Grammar" contains the most general statement of Montague's formal framework for the description of language. The central idea is that anything that should count as a grammar should be able to be cast in the following form: The syntax is an algebra; the semantics is an algebra; and there is a homomorphism mapping elements of the syntactic algebra onto elements of the semantic algebra. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It provides a succinct categorical interface to most of them, free of their diverse implementation details, using the ideas and structures that in the meantime emerged from research in semantics of computation and programming. The salient feature of the language of monoidal categories is that it is supported by a sound and complete graphical formalism, string diagrams, which provide a concrete and intuitive interface for abstract reasoning about computation. The original motivation and the ultimate goal of this effort is to provide a convenient high level programming language for a theory of computational resources, such as one-way functions, and trapdoor functions, by adopting the methods for hiding the low level implementation details that emerged from practice. In the present paper, we make a first step towards this ambitious goal, and sketch a path to reach it. This path is pursued in three sequel papers, that are in preparation.},

In the present paper, we refine and extend that model of computation to support a formal complexity theory as well. This formalization brings to the foreground the concept of normal complexity measures, which allow decompositions akin to Kleene's normal form. Such measures turn out to be just those where evaluating the complexity of a program does not require substantially more resources than evaluating the program itself. The usual time and space complexity are thus normal measures, whereas the average and the randomized complexity measures are not. While the measures that are not normal provide important design time information about algorithms, and for theoretical analyses, normal measures can also be used at run time, as practical tools of computation, e.g. to set the bounds for hypothesis testing, inductive inference and algorithmic learning.},

abstract = {Cryptography is a theory of secret functions. Category theory is a general theory of functions. Cryptography has reached a stage where its structures often take several pages to define, and its formulas sometimes run from page to page. Category theory has some complicated definitions as well, but one of its specialties is taming the flood of structure. Cryptography seems to be in need of high level methods, whereas category theory always needs concrete applications. So why is there no categorical cryptography? One reason may be that the foundations of modern cryptography are built from probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machines, and category theory does not have a good handle on such things. On the other hand, such foundational problems might be the very reason why cryptographic constructions often resemble low level machine programming. I present some preliminary explorations towards categorical cryptography. It turns out that some of the main security concepts are easily characterized through the categorical technique of *diagram chasing*, which was first used Lambek's seminal `Lecture Notes on Rings and Modules'.},

abstract = {Monoidal computer is a categorical model of intensional computation, where many different programs correspond to the same input-output behavior. The upshot of yet another model of computation is that a categorical formalism should provide a much needed high level language for theory of computation, flexible enough to allow abstracting away the low level implementation details when they are irrelevant, or taking them into account when they are genuinely needed. A salient feature of the approach through monoidal categories is the formal graphical language of string diagrams, which supports visual reasoning about programs and computations. In the present paper, we provide a coalgebraic characterization of monoidal computer. It turns out that the availability of interpreters and specializers, that make a monoidal category into a monoidal computer, is equivalent with the existence of a *universal state space*, that carries a weakly final state machine for any pair of input and output types. Being able to program state machines in monoidal computers allows us to represent Turing machines, to capture their execution, count their steps, as well as, e.g., the memory cells that they use. The coalgebraic view of monoidal computer thus provides a convenient diagrammatic language for studying computability and complexity.},

author = {Piedeleu, Robin},
date = {2014},
institution = {{University of Oxford}},
abstract = {Abstract Building on existing categorical accounts of natural language semantics, we propose a compositional distributional model of ambiguous meaning. Originally inspired by the high-level category theoretic language of quantum information protocols, the compositional, distributional categorical model provides a conceptually motivated procedure to compute the meaning of a sentence, given its grammatical structure and an empirical derivation of the meaning of its parts. Grammar is given a type-logical description in a compact closed category while the meaning of words is represented in a finite inner product space model. Since the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces is also compact closed, the type-checking deduction process lifts to a concrete meaning-vector computation via a strong monoidal functor between the two categories. The advantage of reasoning with these structures is that grammatical composition admits an interpretation in terms of flow of meaning between words. Pushing the analogy with quantum mechanics further, we describe ambiguous words as statistical ensembles of unambiguous concepts and extend the semantics of the previous model to a category that supports probabilistic mixing. We introduce two different Frobenius algebras representing different ways of composing the meaning of words, and discuss their properties. We conclude with a range of applications to the case of definitions, including a meaning update rule that reconciles the meaning of an ambiguous word with that of its definition.},

Moreover, just like CQM allows for varying the model in which we interpret quantum axioms, one can also vary the model in which we interpret word meaning. In this paper we show that further developments in categorical quantum mechanics are relevant to natural language processing too. Firstly, Selinger's CPM-construction allows for explicitly taking into account lexical ambiguity and distinguishing between the two inherently different notions of homonymy and polysemy. In terms of the model in which we interpret word meaning, this means a passage from the vector space model to density matrices. Despite this change of model, standard empirical methods for comparing meanings can be easily adopted, which we demonstrate by a small-scale experiment on real-world data. Secondly, commutative classical structures as well as their non-commutative counterparts that arise in the image of the CPM-construction allow for encoding relative pronouns, verbs and adjectives, and finally, iteration of the CPM-construction, something that has no counterpart in the quantum realm, enables one to accommodate both entailment and ambiguity.},

abstract = {Inspired by the pioneering work of Petri and the rise of diagrammatic formalisms to reason about networks of open systems, we introduce the resource calculus---a graphical language for distributed systems. Like process algebras, the resource calculus is modular, with primitive connectors from which all diagrams can be built. We characterise its equational theory by proving a full completeness result for an interpretation in the symmetric monoidal category of additive relations---a result that constitutes the main contribution of this thesis.     Additive relations are frequently exploited by model-checking algorithms for Petri nets. In this thesis, we recognise them as a fundamental algebraic structure of concurrency and use them as an axiomatic framework. Surprisingly, the resource calculus has the same syntax as that of interacting Hopf algebras, a diagrammatic formalism for linear (time-invariant dynamical) systems. Indeed, the approach stems from the simple but fruitful realisation that, by replacing values in a field with values in the semiring of non-negative integers, concurrent behaviour patterns emerge. This change of model reflects the interpretation of diagrams as systems manipulating limited and discrete resources instead of continuous signals.     We also extend the resource calculus in two orthogonal directions. First, by adding an affine primitive to express access to a constant quantity of resources. The extended calculus is remarkably expressive and allows the formulation of non-additive patterns of behaviour, like mutual exclusion. Once more, we characterise it---this time as the equational theory of the symmetric monoidal category of polyhedral relations, discrete analogues of polyhedra in convex geometry. Secondly, we add a synchronous register to model stateful systems. The stateful resource calculus is expressive enough to faithfully capture the behaviour of Petri nets while being strictly more expressive. It is also shown to axiomatise a category of open Petri nets, in the style of the connector algebras of nets with boundaries first studied by Bruni, Melgratti, Montanari and Soboci\'nski.},

The paper makes the assumption that part of the nodes are \textbackslash emph\{Byzantine\}, and are thus controlled by an adversary who intends to either delay the consensus, or break it. This defines that at least a couple of honest nodes come to different conclusions. We prove that, nevertheless, the protocol works with high probability when its parameters are suitably chosen. Along this the paper also provides explicit estimates on the probability that the protocol finalizes in the consensus state in a given time. This protocol could be applied to reaching consensus in decentralized cryptocurrency systems. A special feature of it is that it makes use of a sequence of random numbers which are either provided by a trusted source or generated by the nodes themselves using some decentralized random number generating protocol. This increases the overall trustworthiness of the infrastructure. A core contribution of the paper is that it uses a \textbackslash emph\{very weak\} consensus to obtain a \textbackslash emph\{strong\} consensus on the value of a bit, and which can relate to the validity of a transaction.},

abstract = {A combinatorial theory of associative \$n\$-categories has recently been proposed, with strictly associative and unital composition in all dimensions, and the weak structure arising as a combinatorial notion of homotopy with a natural geometrical interpretation. Such a theory has the potential to serve as an attractive foundation for a computer proof assistant for higher category theory, since it allows composites to be uniquely described, and relieves proofs from the bureaucracy of associators, unitors and their coherence. However, this basic theory lacks a high-level way to construct homotopies, which would be intractable to build directly in complex situations; it is not therefore immediately amenable to implementation. We tackle this problem by describing a contraction operation, which algorithmically constructs complex homotopies that reduce the lengths of composite terms. This contraction procedure allows building of nontrivial proofs by repeatedly contracting subterms, and also allows the contraction of those proofs themselves, yielding in some cases single-step witnesses for complex homotopies. We prove correctness of this procedure by showing that it lifts connected colimits from a base category to a category of zigzags, a procedure which is then iterated to yield a contraction mechanism in any dimension. We also present homotopy.io, an online proof assistant that implements the theory of associative \$n\$-categories, and use it to construct a range of examples that illustrate this new contraction mechanism.},

location = {{Princeton, New Jersey}},
abstract = {Considered by many to be Abraham Robinson's magnum opus, this book offers an explanation of the development and applications of non-standard analysis by the mathematician who founded the subject. Non-standard analysis grew out of Robinson's attempt to resolve the contradictions posed by infinitesimals within calculus. He introduced this new subject in a seminar at Princeton in 1960, and it remains as controversial today as it was then. This paperback reprint of the 1974 revised edition is indispensable reading for anyone interested in non-standard analysis. It treats in rich detail many areas of application, including topology, functions of a real variable, functions of a complex variable, and normed linear spaces, together with problems of boundary layer flow of viscous fluids and rederivations of Saint-Venant's hypothesis concerning the distribution of stresses in an elastic body.},

abstract = {Signal processing is the discipline of extracting information from collections of measurements. To be effective, the measurements must be organized and then filtered, detected, or transformed to expose the desired information. Distortions caused by uncertainty, noise, and clutter degrade the performance of practical signal processing systems. In aggressively uncertain situations, the full truth about an underlying signal cannot be known. This book develops the theory and practice of signal processing systems for these situations that extract useful, qualitative information using the mathematics of topology -- the study of spaces under continuous transformations. Since the collection of continuous transformations is large and varied, tools which are topologically-motivated are automatically insensitive to substantial distortion. The target audience comprises practitioners as well as researchers, but the book may also be beneficial for graduate students.},

A graphical coend calculus can then be used to reason about open diagrams and their compositions. This is work in progress.},

In probabilistic terms, the hypothesis is that prototypicality is a function of the total cue validity of the attributes of items. In Experiments 1 and 3, subjects listed attributes for members of semantic categories which had been previously rated for degree of prototypicality. High positive correlations were obtained between those ratings and the extent of distribution of an item's attributes among the other items of the category. In Experiments 2 and 4, subjects listed superordinates of category members and listed attributes of members of contrasting categories. Negative correlations were obtained between prototypicality and superordinates other than the category in question and between prototypicality and an item's possession of attributes possessed by members of contrasting categories. Experiments 5 and 6 used artificial categories and showed that family resemblance within categories and lack of overlap of elements with contrasting categories were correlated with ease of learning, reaction time in identifying an item after learning, and rating of prototypicality of an item. It is argued that family resemblance offers an alternative to criterial features in defining categories.},

The present study evaluated the reliability of these measures. Observational data came from three independent laboratory studies designed to elicit a wide range of spontaneous expressions of emotion.

abstract = {We provide a complete generators and relations presentation of the 2-dimensional extended unoriented and oriented bordism bicategories as symmetric monoidal bicategories. Thereby we classify these types of 2-dimensional extended topological field theories with arbitrary target bicategory. As an immediate corollary we obtain a concrete classification when the target is the symmetric monoidal bicategory of algebras, bimodules, and intertwiners over a fixed commutative ground ring. In the oriented case, such an extended topological field theory is equivalent to specifying a (non-commutative) separable symmetric Frobenius algebra. The text is divided into three chapters. The first develops a variant of higher Morse theory and uses it to obtain a combinatorial description of surfaces suitable for the higher categorical language used later. The second chapter is an extensive treatment of the theory of symmetric monoidal bicategories. We introduce several stricter variants on the notion of symmetric monoidal bicategory, and give a very general treatment of the notion of presentation by generators and relations. Finally we provide a host of strictification and cohernece results for symmetric monoidal bicategories. The final chapter focuses on extended tqfts. We give a precise treatment of the extended bordism bicategory equipped with additional structure (such as framings or orientations). We apply the results of the previous two chapters to obtain a simple presentation of both the oriented and unoriented bordism bicategories, and describe the general method to obtain such classifications for other choices of structure. We examine the consequences of our classification when the target is the bicategory of algebras, bimodules, and maps, over a fixed commutative ground ring.},

Well-known temporal logics---such as Linear and Metric Temporal Logic (LTL and MTL)---embed within the logic of temporal type theory. The types in this theory represent "behavior types". The language is rich enough to allow one to define arbitrary hybrid dynamical systems, which are mixtures of continuous dynamics---e.g. as described by a differential equation---and discrete jumps. In particular, the derivative of a continuous real-valued function is internally defined. We construct a semantics for the temporal type theory in the topos of sheaves on a translation-invariant quotient of the standard interval domain. In fact, domain theory plays a recurring role in both the semantics and the type theory.},

"It is toward the reduction of seemingly diverse processes to simple laws that a science of behavior naturally directs itself. At the present time I know of no simplification of behavior that can be claimed for a neurological fact. Increasingly greater simplicity is being achieved, but through a systematic treatment of behavior at its own level." The results of behavior studies set problems for neurology, and in some cases constitute the sole factual basis for neurological constructs. The system developed in the present book is objective and descriptive. Behavior is regarded as either respondent or operant. Respondent behavior is elicited by observable stimuli, and classical conditioning has utilized this type of response. In the case of operant behavior no correlated stimulus can be detected when the behavior occurs. The factual part of the book deals largely with this behavior as studied by the author in extensive researches on the feeding responses of rats. The conditioning of such responses is compared with the stimulus conditioning of Pavlov. Particular emphasis is placed on the concept of "reflex reserve," a process which is built up during conditioning and exhausted during extinction, and on the concept of reflex strength. The chapter headings are as follows: a system of behavior; scope and method; conditioning and extinction; discrimination of a stimulus; some functions of stimuli; temporal discrimination of the stimulus; the differentiation of a response; drive; drive and conditioning; other variables affecting reflex strength; behavior and the nervous system; and conclusion.},

We show that morphisms of schemas induce three "data migration functors", which translate instances from one schema to the other in canonical ways. These functors parameterize projections, unions, and joins over all tables simultaneously and can be used in place of conjunctive and disjunctive queries. We also show how to connect a database and a functional programming language by introducing a functorial connection between the schema and the category of types for that language. We begin the paper with a multitude of examples to motivate the definitions, and near the end we provide a dictionary whereby one can translate database concepts into category-theoretic concepts and vice-versa.},

The mathematics presented here is what guided the implementation process, and we deemed very useful to release it to the public to help people wanting to audit our work to better understand the code itself.},

A new set-theoretical approach to similarity is developed in which objects are represented as collections of features and similarity is described as a feature-matching process. Specifically, a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model, which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features. Several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representations of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees. It is also used to analyze the relations of prototypicality and family resemblance.},

The syntactic architecture of such interconnections is encoded using the visual language of wiring diagrams. We define the symmetric monoidal category W, from which we may construct an operad O(W), whose objects are black boxes with input and output ports, and whose morphisms are wiring diagrams, thus prescribing the algebraic rules for interconnection. We then define two W-algebras, G and L, which associate semantic content to the structures in W. Respectively, they correspond to general and to linear systems of differential equations, in which an internal state is controlled by inputs and produces outputs. As an example, we use these algebras to formalize the classical problem of systems of tanks interconnected by pipes, and hence make explicit the algebraic relationships among systems at different levels of granularity.},

The posterior of the structural parameters is estimated by a new Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with mixing parallel sequences. The parallel extension improves the global maximization property of the algorithm, simplifies the parameterization for an appropriate acceptance ratio, and allows a simple implementation of the estimation on parallel computers.

abstract = {As first main contribution, this thesis characterises the PROP SVk of linear subspaces over a field k - an important domain of interpretation for circuit diagrams appearing in diverse research areas. We present by generators and equations the PROP IH of string diagrams whose free model is SVk. IH stands for interacting Hopf algebras: its equations arise by distributive laws between Hopf algebras, which we obtain using Lack's technique for composing PROPs. The significance of the result is two-fold. First, it offers a canonical diagrammatic syntax for linear algebra: linear maps, kernels, subspaces, etc... are all faithfully represented in the graphical language. Second, the equations of IH describe familiar algebraic structures - Hopf algebras and Frobenius algebras - which are at the heart of graphical formalisms as seemingly diverse as quantum circuits, signal flow graphs, simple electrical circuits and Petri nets. Our characterisation enlightens the provenance of these axioms and reveals their linear algebraic nature. Our second main contribution is an application of IH to the semantics of signal processing circuits. We develop a formal theory of signal flow graphs, featuring a diagrammatic circuit syntax, a structural operational semantics and a denotational semantics. We prove completeness of the equations of IH for denotational equivalence. Also, we study full abstraction: it turns out that the purely operational picture is too concrete - two denotationally equal graphs may exhibit different operational behaviour. We classify the ways in which this can occur and show that any graph can be realised - rewritten, using the equations of IH, into an executable form where the operational behaviour and the denotation coincide. This realisability theorem suggests a reflection about the role of causality in the semantics of signal flow graphs and, more generally, of computing devices.},
