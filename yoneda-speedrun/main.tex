\section{The Big Picture}

The Yoneda Lemma is a basic and beloved result in category theory. In most treatments it
shows up fairly early in the books and lecture notes on the subject. Its statement is also
deceivingly compact because all of its content is buried inside layers of abstraction and
notation that would have been built up while working through the conceptual basis of
category theory.

In particular the result ties together the following sets of ideas:

\begin{itemize}

\item Categories (objects and arrows).
\item Categories and sets
\item Functors
\item Natural transformations
\item Functor categories

\end{itemize}

\noindent
For me the hard part of understanding this result was unwrapping the abstraction ladder in
its statement, especially when the definitions required to do so are spread across several
different sections of whatever book or lecture notes you are reading.

I am going to do the following dumb thing: I am going to state the result in several
different kinds of notation and then define the only the pieces we need to make that
notation make sense as fast as possible, so all of the material is contained in a single
small document for easy reference. In the spirit of video game speedruns, it will be only
what is absolutely necessary, and it will skip a lot of interesting material that you
should really talk about before completing the cateogry theory ``game'', but which we can
ignore for our purposes right now.

Note that I am not a mathematician or a category theory expert. I'm just a guy trying to
figure out the notation. So everything in this document is probably wrong.

\section{Statement of the Lemma}

This section lists several statements of the Lemma that use various different notations.
You will notice that all of the statements have the same shape, but they all seem to be
using slightly different language. The sections after this one will unwrap all the
language.

\begin{lemma}[Yoneda]   
\label{yoneda1}
Let $\CC$ be a locally small category.  Then
%
\begin{equation}        
\label{eq:yoneda}
\pshf{\CC}(\h_X, F)
\iso
F(X)
\end{equation}
%
naturally in $X \in \CC$ and $F \in \pshf{\CC}$.  
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Yoneda]\label{yoneda2} Let $\CC$ be a locally small category and $X \in
\CC$. Then for any functor $F : \CC \to \Set$ there is a bijection
$$
\Hom(\CC(X,-), F) \iso FX
$$
that associates each natural transformation $\alpha:\CC(X,-) \fto F$ with the element
$\alpha_X(1_X) \in FX$. Moreover, this correspondence is natural in both $X$ and $F$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Yoneda]\label{yoneda3} For any locally small category $\CC$, object $X \in
\CC$, and functor $F:\CC \to \Set$ we have  $\Nat(\CC(X,-),F) \iso FX$ both naturally in
$X \in \CC$ and $F \in [\CC, \Set]$
\end{lemma}

\noindent You can also write that one an opposite way:

\begin{lemma}[Yoneda]\label{yoneda4} For any locally small category $\CC$, object $X \in
\CC$, and functor $F:\CC^{\op} \to \Set$ we have  $\Nat(\CC(-,X),F) \iso FX$ both
naturally in $X \in \CC$ and $F \in [\CC^{\op}, \Set]$
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Yoneda]\label{yoneda5} Let $\cat{C}$ be a category, let $X$ be an object of
 $\cat{C}$, and let $F:\cat{C}^\op\to\Set$ be a presheaf on $\cat{C}$. Consider the map
 from
 $$
 \Hom_{[\cat{C}^\op,\Set]} \bigl(\Hom_\cat{C} (-,X) , F \bigr) \to FX
 $$
 assigning to a natural transformation $\alpha:\Hom_\cat{C} (-,X)\fto F$ the element
 $\alpha_X(\id_X)\in FX$, which is the value of the component $\alpha_X$ of $\alpha$ on
 the identity at $X$. 

 This assignment is a bijection, and it is natural both in $X$ and in $F$.
\end{lemma}

\noindent\goodbreak This version peels away some of the layers:

\begin{lemma}[Yoneda]\label{yoneda6} Let $\CC$ be a locally small category, let $X$ be an
object of $\CC$, and let $F: \CC \to \Set$ be a functor. Then

(i) There is a bijection between the set of natural transformations from $\CC(X, -)$ to
$F$ and the elements of $FX$

(ii) The bijection in (i) is natural in both $F$ and $X$.
\end{lemma}

\noindent
I've made these statements look a bit more uniform than they do in real life just by using
the same style of typesetting for all of them. But, there is still a lot to unpack. So
let's get into it.

\section{Categories}

Categories have a deliciously multi-part definition.

\begin{defn}
\label{category}
A {\it category} $\CC$ consists of:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item 
A collection of {\it objects} that we will denote with upper case letters $X, Y, Z, ...$,
and so on.  
We call this collection $\objc$. Traditionally people write just $\CC$ to mean $\objc$
when the context makes clear what is going on.
\item
A collection of {\it arrows} denoted with lower case letters $f, g, h, ...$, and so on.
Other names for {\it arrows} include {\it mappings} or {\it functions} or {\it morphims}.
We will call this collection $\Arrows(\CC)$. \end{itemize}%
The objects and arrows of a category satisfy:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Each arrow $f$ maps one object $A \in \objc$ to another object $B \in \objc$ and we denote
this by writing $f: A \to B$. Here $A$ is called the {\it domain} of $f$ and $B$ the {\it
codomain}.

\item
For each pair of arrows $f:A \to B$ and $g : B \to C$ we can form a new arrow $g \circ f:
A \to C$ called the {\it composition} of $f$ and $g$. This is also sometimes written $gf$.
\item
For each $A \in \objc$ there is a function $1_A: A \to A$, called the {\it identity} at
$A$ that maps $A$ to itself. Sometimes this object is also written as $\id_A$.
\end{itemize}
Finally, we have the last two rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item For any $f: A \to B$ we have that $1_B \circ f$ and $f \circ 1_A$ are both equal to
$f$. 
\item Given $f: A \to B$, $g: B \to C$, $h: C\to D$ we have that $(h \circ g) \circ f = h
\circ (g \circ f)$, or alternatively $(hg)f$ = $h(gf)$. What this also means is that we
can always just write $hgf$ if we want. \end{itemize}%
\end{defn}%
\noindent
We will call the collection of all arrows from $A$ to $B$ $\Arrows_{\CC}(A, B)$. We will
usually write $\Arrows(A,B)$ when it's clear what category $A$ and $B$ come from.
Traditionally people write $\Hom(A, B)$ or $\Hom_{\CC}(A,B)$, or just $\CC(A,B)$ to mean
$\Arrows(A,B)$. Here ``$\Hom$'' stands for homomorphism, which is a word that often means
mappings that preserve some kind of structure.

At this point every category theory book will list a few dozen examples of categories that
show up in various areas of math. These will have strangely truncated names like
$\cat{Measu}$ or $\cat{Htpy}$ or $\cat{Matr}$%
\footnote{The general fear of readable names in the mathematical literature is fascinating
to me, having spent most of my life trying to think up readable names in program source
code. In the modern world of \LaTeX\ there is no reason to limit names to being only four
or five random letters in length. Thus, I have done the unthinkable and written many names
out in full.}%
and will be typeset in a different font. For these short notes I think the only specific
category that we will run into is $\cat{Set}$, where the objects are sets and the arrows
are mappings between sets.

Speaking of sets, the definition of categories we were careful about not calling anything
a {\it set}. This is because some categories involve collections of things that are too
``large'' to be called sets and not get into set theory trouble. Here are two more short
definitions about this that we will need.

\begin{defn}
A category $\CC$ is called {\it small} if $\Arrows(\CC)$ is a set.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
A category $\CC$ is called {\it locally small} if $\Arrows_{\CC}(A,B)$ is a set for every
$A, B \in \CC$. \end{defn}%
\noindent
For the rest of this note we will only deal with locally small categories, since in the
the setup for the Lemma, we are given a category $\CC$ that is locally small.

Finally, one more notion that we'll need later is the idea of an {\it isomorphism}.

\begin{defn}
An arrow $f: X \to Y$ in a category $\CC$ is an {\it isomorphism} if there exists an arrow
$g: B \to A$ such that $gf = 1_X$ and $fg = 1_Y$. We say that the objects $X$ and $Y$ are
{\it isomorphic} to each other whenever there exists an isomorphism between them. If two
objects in a category are isomorphic to each other we write $X \iso Y$.
\end{defn}
\noindent
Note that in the category $\cat{Set}$ the isomorphisms are exactly the invertible mappings
between sets.

\medskip
As we navigate our way from basic categories up to the statement of the lemma we will
travel through multiple layers conceptual abstraction. Functors are the first step up this
ladder.

\section{Functors}

Functors are the {\it arrows between categories}. That is, if you were to define the
category where the objects were all categories of some kind then the arrows would be
functors. Of course you have to be careful about how you do this to not get into set
theory trouble, but if all the categories are small it works out.

\goodbreak
\begin{defn}
Given two categories $\CC$ and $\DD$ a {\it functor} $F : \CC \to \DD$ is defined by two
sets of parallel rules. First:
\begin{itemize}
\item For each object $X \in \CC$ we assign an object $F(X) \in \DD$.
\item For each arrow $f: X \to Y$ in $\CC$ we assign an arrow $F(f): F(X) \to F(Y)$ in
$\DD$.
\end{itemize}
\noindent
So $F$ maps objects in $\CC$ to objects in $\DD$ and also arrows in $\CC$ to arrows in
$\DD$ such that the domains and codomains match up the right way. That is, the domain of
$F(f)$ is $F$ applied to the domain of $f$, and the codomain of $F(f)$ is $F$ applied to
the codomain of $f$. In addition the following must be true:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $f:X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to Z$ are arrows in $\CC$ then $F(g \circ f) = F(g) \circ
F(f)$ (or $F(gf) = F(g)F(f)$).
\item For every $X \in \CC$ it is the case that $F(1_X) = 1_{F(X)}$.
\end{itemize}

\end{defn}
\noindent
So, a functor consists of two mappings, one on objects and one on arrows. And, these
mappings preserve all of the structure of a category, namely domains and codomains,
composition, and identities.

We'll define one more notation for convenience here

\begin{defn}
Given any functor $F: \CC \to \DD$ from a category $\CC$ to another category $\DD$ and an
object $X \in \CC$ we may write $F X$ to mean $F(X)$. This is analogous to the more
compact notation for composition of arrows above.
\end{defn}
\noindent
Some of the statements of the Lemma use this notation for both arrows and functors.

Functors are notationally confusing because we are using one letter to denote two
mappings. So if $F: \CC \to \DD$ and $X \in \CC$ then $F(X)$ is the functor applied to the
object, which will be an object in $\DD$. On the other hand, if $f : A \to B$ is an arrow
in $\CC$ then $F(f)$ is an arrow in $\DD$. This seems obvious from the definition but in
proofs and calculations the notations will often shift back and forth without enough
context and can be very confusing.

Functors appear in the Lemma in a couple of places. The core content of the result has to
do with when one set of functors is isomorphic (in some sense) to another set of functors.
To see how we study that question we need go up one more step in our abstraction ladder
and ask: what do arrows between functors look like?

\section{Natural Transformations}

Natural transformations map functors to functors in the same way that arrows in a category
map objects to objects. The definition is a bit more complicated and abstract, but that's
what it ultimately means.

\begin{defn}
Let $\CC$ and $\DD$ be categories, and let $F$ and $G$ be functors $\CC \to \DD$. To
define a \emph{natural transformation} $\alpha$ from $F$ to $G$, we assign to each object
$X$ of $\CC$, an arrow $\alpha_X:FX\to GX$ in $\DD$, called the \emph{component} of
$\alpha$ at $X$. In addition, for each arrow $f:X\to Y$ of $\CC$, the following diagram
has to commute:
  $$
  \begin{tikzcd}
   FX \ar{r}{Ff} \ar{d}{\alpha_X} & FY \ar{d}{\alpha_{Y}} \\
   GX \ar{r}{Gf} & GY
  \end{tikzcd}
  $$
\end{defn}
\noindent
This is the first commutative diagram that I've tossed up. There is no magic here. The
idea is that you get the same result no matter which way you travel through the diagram.
So here $\alpha_Y \circ F$ and $G \circ \alpha_X$ must be equal.

We denote natural transformations as double arrows, $\alpha: F \fto G$, to distinguish
them in diagrams from functors (which are denoted by single arrows):
 $$
 \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
  \CC \ar[bend left,""{below,name=F}]{r}{F} \ar[bend right,""{above,name=G}]{r}[swap]{G} & \DD
  \ar[Rightarrow,from=F,to=G,"\,\alpha"]
 \end{tikzcd}
 $$

You might wonder to yourself: what makes natural transformations ``natural''? The answer
appears to be related to the fact that you can construct them from {\it only} what is
given to you in the categories at hand. The natural transformation takes the action of $F$
on $\CC$ and lines it up exactly with the action of $G$ on $\CC$. No other assumptions or
conditions are needed. In this sense they define a relationship between functors that is
just sitting there in the world no matter what, and thus ``natural''. Another apt way of
putting this is that natural transformations give a canonical way of mapping between the
images of two functors.

As with arrows, it will be useful to define what an isomorphism means in the context of
natural transformations:

\begin{defn}
A {\it natural isomorphism} is a natural transformation $\alpha: F \fto G$ in which every
component $\alpha_X$ is an isomorphism. In this case, the natural isomorphism may be
depicted as $\alpha: F \iso G$.
\end{defn}

In addition we'll use this notation:

\begin{defn}
Let $\CC$ and $\DD$ be categories, and let $F$ and $G$ be functors $\CC \to \DD$. Then we'll write $\Nat(F, G)$ 
for the set of all natural transformations from $F$ to $G$.
\end{defn}
\noindent
You will also see people write $\Hom(F, G)$ or $\CC(F, G)$ for this, which makes sense overloads $\Hom$
to work on both categories and functors.

\section{Functor Categories}

We are almost there, but we need to travel one more step up the abstraction ladder. We
have in our one hand objects called functors, and we have in our other hand the natural
transformations. So the next obvious thing is to make a category out of them.

\begin{defn}
 Let $\CC$ and $\DD$ be categories. The \emph{functor category} between $\CC$ and $\DD$ is
 constructed as follows:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Objects are functors $F: \CC \to \DD$;
  \item Morphisms are natural transformations $\alpha:F\fto G$.
 \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\noindent
Right now you should be wondering to yourself: ``wait, does this definition actually
work?'' I have brazenly claimed without any real justification that the natural
transformations work as arrows. Luckily it's fairly clear that this works out if you just
do everything component-wise. So if we have all of these things: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Three functors, $F: \CC \to \DD$ and $G: \CC \to \DD$ and $H:\CC \to \DD$.

\item Two natural transformations $\alpha: F \fto G$ and $\beta: G \fto H$

\item One object $X \in \CC$.
\end{itemize}
\noindent
Then you can define $(\beta \circ \alpha)(X) = \beta(X) \circ \alpha(X)$ and you get the
right behavior. Similarly, the identity transformation $1_F$ can be defined
component-wise: $(1_F)(X) = 1_{F(X)}$.

There are a lot of standard notations for this object, none of which I really like. The
most popular seems to be $[\CC, \DD]$, but you also see $\DD^{\CC}$, and various  
abbreviations like $\mathop{\mathit{Fun}}(\CC,\DD)$ or $\mathop{\mathit{Func}}(\CC,\DD)$,
or $\mathop{\mathit{Funct}}(\CC,\DD)$. I think we should just spell it out and use
$\Fun(\CC,\DD)$. So there.

\section{Opposites/Duals}

Duality in mathematics comes up in a lot of different ways. Covering it all is way beyond
the scope of these notes. But for the purposes of the lemma we need this:

\begin{defn}
Let $\CC$ be a category. Then we write $\CCop$ for the {\it opposite} or {\it dual}
category of $\CC$, and define it as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The objects of $\CCop$ are the same as the objects of $\CC$.
\item $\Arrows(\CCop)$ is defined by taking each arrow $f :X \to Y$ in $\Arrows(\CC)$ and
flipping their direction, so we put $f': Y \to X$ into $\Arrows(\CCop)$. In particular for
$X, Y \in \Objects(\CC)$ we have $\Arrows_{\CC}(A, B) = \Arrows_{\CCop}(B, A)$ (or $\CC(A,
B) = \CCop(B, A)$.
\item Composition of arrows is the same, but with the arguments reversed.
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\noindent
The {\it principle of duality} then says, informally, that every categorical definition,
theorem and proof has a dual, obtained by reversing all the arrows.

You will have noticed that some of the statements of the Lemma refer to $\CCop$ and some
do not. These results are all basically equivalent, except for how the arrows go.

The opposite category also leads to some terminology for functors that you will see used a
lot:

\begin{defn}
Given categories $\CC$ and $\DD$ a {\it contravariant} functor from $\CC$ to $\DD$ is a
functor $F: \CCop \to \DD$ where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $F(X) \in \Objects(\DD)$ for each $X \in \objc$.
\item For each arrow $f \in \Arrows(\CC)$ an arrow $F(X): Y \to X$.
\end{itemize}
\goodbreak
\noindent
In addition
\begin{itemize}
\item For any two arrows $f, g \in \Arrows(\CC)$ where $g \circ f$ is defined we have
$F(f) \circ F(g) = F(g \circ f)$.
\item For each $X \in \Objects(\CC)$ we have $1_{F(X)} = F(1_X)$
\end{itemize}

\end{defn}
\noindent
Note how the arrows go backwards when they need to. With this terminology in mind, we call
regular functors from $\CC \to \DD$ {\it covariant}.

Category theory loves overloaded notation, so I've done it too. Here is a list of some
examples.

No two writers seem to agree on what basic notations to use for basic concepts. So I've
made up my own shit too.
