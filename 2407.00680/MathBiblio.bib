Abstract = {The authors study the properties of models of elementary Peano arithmetic $P$ and their theories. In Section 2 they study the theories of submodels and end-extensions of a non-standard model $M$ of Peano arithmetic. They show that $M$ has $2^{\boldsymbol\aleph_0}$ initial segments, whose theories are various extensions of $P$. If $M$ is countable then there is an $M'$, having initial segments of the same isomorphism type, but not elementarily equivalent to $M$. A countable $M$ has $2^{\boldsymbol\aleph_0}$ countable end extensions whose theories are different extensions of $P$. \par In Section 3 they introduce a partial ordering on complete extensions of $P\colon T_1\leq T_2$ if any model of $T_1$ is embeddable into a model of $T_2$. They prove that this ordering is a tree and study some of its properties. They show that if all the members of a countable family $F$ of countable models of $P$ are embeddable into the same model of $P$ then there exists a $T\supseteq P$ such that each me},

Mycielski has shown that there is a first order axiom LM (the Leibniz-Mycielski axiom) such that for any completion T of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory ZF, T has a Leibnizian model if and only if T proves LM. Here we prove: THEOREM A. Every complete theory T extending ZF + LM has $2^{\aleph_{0}}$ nonisomorphic countable Leibnizian models. THEOREM B. If $\kappa$ is aprescribed definable infinite cardinal of a complete theory T extending ZF + V = OD. then there are $2^{\aleph_{1}}$ nonisomorphic Leibnizian models $\mathfrak{M}$ of T of power $\aleph_{1}$ such that $(\kappa^{+})^\mathfrak{M}$ is $\aleph_{1}-like$.

A Ramsey theorem is proved to the effect that any partitioning into $r$ classes of the $k$-parameter subsets of any sufficiently large $n$-parameter set must result in some $l$-parameter subset with all its $k$-parameter subsets in one class. Among the immediate corollaries are the lower dimensional cases of a Ramsey theorem for finite vector spaces (a conjecture of Rota), the theorem of van der Waerden on arithmetic progressions, a set theoretic generalization of a theorem of Schur, and Ramsey's Theorem itself.},

It is argued that, for Frege, the Caesar problem is a bundle of related problems of which the semantic problem is the most basic one.},

The method can be used to partition R3 into unlinked circles of radius one, which answers a question posed by Wilker [7], or into arbitrary collections of real analytic curves.

abstract="One says that the sets x and y are equinumerous (in symbols, x â‰ˆ y) if there is a 1 -- 1 function mapping x on y. The notion of the cardinal |x| of x is obtained from equinumerosity by abstraction. The use of |x| does usually not require any special apparatus. E.g., when we say |x| --- â„µ0 we mean to say that there is a 1 -- 1 function mapping x on the set of all natural numbers; when we say |x| < |y| we mean that there are 1 -- 1 functions mapping x into y, but none of them is onto y; etc. As is common in mathematics, one tends to pass from the abstract notion of cardinal numbers to real cardinal numbers, i.e., one wants to regard the cardinal numbers as objects of the mathematical system. This is where one encounters the problem of how to define the cardinal | x | of x as an object of set theory.",

Abstract = {From the introduction and summary: ``Both model-theoretic methods (Ryll-Nardzewski; Rabin) and proof-theoretic methods (Mostowski; Montague) have been used to show that Peano arithmetic PA is not finitely axiomatizable. Let $\scr A$ be any consistent extension of PA and let $\scr A_n^0$ denote the set of $\Pi_n^0$ consequences of $\scr A$. Employing incompleteness theorems to generate independent formulas and completeness theorems to construct models, we build nonstandard models of $\scr A_{n+2}^0$ in which the standard integers are $\Delta_{n+1}^0$ definable. We thus pinpoint induction axioms which are not provable in $\scr A_{n+2}^0$; in particular, we show that (parameter-free) $\Delta_1^0$-induction is not provable in primitive recursive arithmetic. The nonfinite axiomatizability results that we obtain in this way are optimal from the point of view of quantifier complexity. We introduce the notion of representability of a theory in a model, which enables us to apply the incomplete},

abstract="Zermelo's 1913, {\"U}ber eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachpiels, is an account of an address given at the Fifth International Congress of Mathematicians in Cambridge in 1912. It is often cited as the first mathematical analysis of strategies in games. While the paper claims to be an application of set theory, and while it would have appeared that way to Zermelo's contemporaries, the set-theoretic notions in the paper have since become part of standard mathematical practice, and to modern eyes the arguments in the paper are more combinatorial than set-theoretic. The notion of ``Zermelo's Theorem'' (usually described as a variant of ``in chess, either White or Black has a winning strategy, or both can force a draw'') derives from this paper. Although statements of this sort follow from the claims made in the paper, Zermelo's arguments for these claims are incomplete. As we shall see below, there are other gaps in the paper, one of which was fixed by D{\'e}nes K{\"o}nig in his 1927a. K{\"o}nig's paper also contains two paragraphs, 1927b, on arguments of Zermelo fixing this gap, using ideas similar to K{\"o}nig's.",
