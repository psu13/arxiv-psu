%%% TODO: suggestions for things to include in future.
%%% Derive the Lund string-fragmentation function
%%% Include a section about jets and jet algorithms
%%% Include a section about hadronic QCD (hadrons and hadron decays)
%%% Elaborate on factorization and PDFs. Show DGLAP evolution equations (and
%%% derive them?) with and without plus prescription (a la AEPSHEP).
%%% Elaborate on matching section, show technical details of each scheme.
%%% Include new multi-leg and NLO schemes, in particular Prestel's.
%%% Fixed-order QCD. Discuss alternatives to subtraction.
%%% Intro: discuss symmetries of QCD Lagrangian. Chiral symmetry and
%%% axions. See eg AEPSHEP lectures by Rubakov.
%%% Include material from 2014 talks on variations of alphaS in
%%% generators. Probably do this in section on showers/generators. Put
%%% a reference in section on alphaS stating that this will be
%%% discussed later in section so-and-so. 
%%% Fixed-Order QCD: include diagrammatic illustrations from slides,
%%% of LO, NLO, etc. 
%%% Either show renormalization procedure to regulate UV divergences
%%% or give reference to where it is covered.

\begin{abstract}
These lectures were originally given at TASI 2012 and 
are directed at a level suitable for 
graduate students in High Energy
Physics. They are intended to give an introduction to 
the theory and phenomenology of quantum  chromodynamics (QCD),
focusing on collider physics applications. The aim is to bring the
reader to a level where informed decisions can be made 
concerning different approaches and their uncertainties. 
The material is divided into five main
areas:  1)~fundamentals, 2)~fixed-order perturbative QCD, 
3)~Monte Carlo event generators and parton showers, 4)~Matching at
Leading and Next-to-Leading Order, and 5)~Hadronization and soft
hadron-hadron physics.
