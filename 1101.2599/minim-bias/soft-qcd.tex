Several distinct physics and modelling issues come under the 
heading of ``soft QCD'' and ``underlying event''. In \SecRef{sec:primkt}  
we discuss ``primordial \kT'', a
topic that lies on the intersection between parton showers and
soft QCD.
The rest of this section is  devoted to a discussion of
the different physics (sub-)processes that  contribute to the total
observed activity in hadron-hadron collisions. 
Thus, in \SecRef{sec:mbtypes}, we give a brief introduction to --- and
dictionary of --- the different 
QCD processes that form the dominant part of the total hadron-hadron
cross section, and to the origin of the so-called ``underlying event''
and the associated ``pedestal effect''.
In \SecRef{sec:mbmpi}, we then 
take a closer look at models based on multiple parton interactions
(MPI). \SecRef{sec:colrec} focuses on the particular issue of colour
reconnections. 
Finally, \SecRef{s_ue:pomerons} gives a very brief introduction to models
of diffraction, in particular models based on pomerons. 

For more specific details on the current implementations in each of
the main generators, see the individual descriptions in
\PartRef{sec:spec-revi-main}. 

\mcsubsection{Primordial \kT \label{sec:primkt}} 

In Monte Carlo models, the term ``primordial \kT'' is used to refer
collectively to any transverse momentum given to initial-state
partons \emph{beyond} that generated by the normal ISR shower
evolution described in \SecRef{sec:isr}.  

Physically, such additional momentum could come from several
sources, as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fermi motion of confined
partons inside their parent hadron, with a magnitude of order the
inverse hadron radius $\sim \LambdaQCD$.  
\item ``Unresolved'' ISR shower activity, coming from scales 
below the infrared cutoff.
\item Activity not accounted for, or incorrectly accounted for, 
by the particular shower model in question. In particular, this may be
relevant for parton evolution involving 
low parton momentum fractions $x$, as was briefly
discussed in \SecRef{sec:isr}.
\end{enumerate}
Of these, only Fermi motion is relatively straightforward.
It is also the only component that is genuinely
``primordial'', \ie intrinsic to the incoming hadron.
The others depend sensitively on issues that are
inherently ambiguous in the shower description: whether the
low-$\pT{}$ divergences in the parton shower are regulated by a sharp
cutoff or by a smooth 
suppression (and in what variable), how $\alphaS$ is treated close to
the cutoff, how the shower radiation functions and recoil effects 
behave, and whether any non-trivial low-$x$ effects are included. 

In the simplest possible treatment one lumps 
all these ``unresolved'' effects, regardless of origin, into 
a single number, called ``primordial \kT''. In each event, the
beam-collinear partons extracted from each of the original hadrons
can then be given a \pt\ of this magnitude, typically distributed
according to a Gaussian or similar distribution. (Since the beam
remnant must necessarily take up the recoil from this kick, 
an upper cutoff is usually also enforced, limiting the amount by
which the beam remnant is allowed to be kicked off axis by 
tails of this effect.)

However, even in this simplified case, the above discussion should serve
to illustrate that the value of the ``primordial \kT'' should not really be
perceived of as a universal constant. At the very least, the shower evolution
equations imply that it must have some  implicit dependence on the ISR cutoff --- 
if we increase the shower cutoff, for instance, 
the primordial \kT should increase slightly as well, to compensate for the now
missing shower activity in the region that has been cut
away. In current models, this scaling does not happen automatically,
but must be taken care of by retuning the primordial \kT if the ISR
cutoff (or any other parameter affecting the infrared regularization
of the initial-state shower) is changed. More troublingly, perhaps, 
since a lot of possible process-dependent physics effects have been
``swept under the rug'', there is also no strong reason why the same 
value of this primordial \kT should work equally well for all
processes or even in different phase space regions. 
Attempting to extract a value for it in several different, mutually
complementary, processes and regions, 
could therefore be a valuable input to guide future modelling. 

A next-to-simplest iteration can be obtained by letting 
the value of primordial \kT scale with the $Q^2$ of the hard
interaction \cite{Sjostrand:2004pf}. This generates a minimum of
process-dependence (\eg partons entering a soft QCD scattering can 
now be given a smaller primordial \kT than ones producing a $Z$
boson), but still does not really address the underlying physics. 

A first stab at a more physical
model was made in \cite{Gieseke:2007ad}, by including a
non-perturbative function that depends explicitly on the phase space
available for unresolved initial-state radiation, in
addition to a smaller and more
universal component to be modelled by a Gaussian. 
Although the data available at the time 
could not clearly differentiate this from the conventional models, 
the expectation is that this should generate a more realistic 
process- and collision-energy-dependence of the effective primordial
\kT.

A secondary modelling issue, relevant to the MPI models discussed in
the next subsection, is how much primordial \kT is assigned to
partons initiating multiple parton interactions, and 
how the associated recoil effects are distributed
among those initiators and the remnant. Typically, MPI initiators are
only assigned a primordial \kT of the order of Fermi motion, 
although this is a model-dependent statement that
may of course change, as models improve.

  (\herwigpp) is shown with four different choices for the
  ``primordial \kT''. a) $p\bar p$ at 1.8 TeV b) $pp$ at
  14 TeV.
\label{fig:primkt}}
\end{figure}
Empirically, the most important distribution for constraining the
magnitude of this effect is the \pt\ distribution of lepton pairs
in Drell-Yan events. The peak of this distribution is extremely
sensitive to infrared effects. In \FigRef[a]{fig:primkt}, we
compare the distribution measured by the CDF
experiment \cite{Affolder:1999jh} 
to  a Monte Carlo model (\herwigpp) with four different primordial-\kT
settings: $0$ GeV (off), 
          $1.9$ GeV (the default in \herwigpp), 
          $3.8$ GeV (twice the default), 
          and the IR-augemented shower
          model \cite{Gieseke:2007ad}. 
To illustrate how these predictions scale with  collider centre-of-mass energy,
keeping the $Q^2$ of the hard interaction fixed, we also include a
plot showing the \pt\ of Drell-Yan pairs in $pp$ collisions at 14 TeV
in \FigRef[b]{fig:primkt}; the distributions becomes broader, but the
peak position stays relatively constant. A comparison of different
generators on this distribution can be found
in \FigRef{fig:cmp:intrinsic-kt} in the comparisons section of the
review (\SecRef{sec:physics-areas-where}). 

It is also worth noting that, depending on the model, details of how
the transverse momenta generated by the initial-state parton shower
and the primordial component are combined, the latter can also have a
significant effect well above the peak region. In the more primitive
models, there is also the (probably artificial) possibility of a
``double-peak'' structure emerging at high energies, with a
higher-\pt\ peak generated by the perturbative shower and a low-\pt\
one by primordial \kT. 

As mentioned above, it is important to consider also
complementary distributions, involving different scales or $x$
values, to fully constrain this ambiguous component of Monte Carlo
models. Good examples here would be the Drell-Yan process at different $Q^2$
values or at different rapidities. A systematic comparison to
extractions in DIS could also be fruitful. 

\mcsubsection{Soft QCD processes\label{sec:mbtypes}}

\paragraph{Elastic and inelastic} Elastic scattering 
consists of  all reactions of the type 
\begin{equation}
A(p_A)B(p_B)\to A(p_A')B(p_B')~,
\end{equation}
where $A$ and $B$ are particles
carrying momenta $p_A$ and $p_B$, respectively. Specifically, 
the only exchanged quantity is momentum; all quantum numbers and
masses remain unaltered, and no new particles are produced. 
Inelastic scattering covers everything else, \ie  
\begin{equation}
 AB\to X \ne AB~,
\end{equation} 
where $X\ne AB$ signifies that one 
or more quantum numbers are changed, or more particles are
produced. The distinction between elastic and inelastic scattering is
physically observable and is therefore quantum mechanically
meaningful (see \SecRef{sec:phys-phil-behind} for further discussion
of this point). 
Thus, we divide the total hadron-hadron cross
section into two physically distinguishable components, 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\mathrm{tot}}(s) = 
\sigma_{\mathrm{el}}(s) +
\sigma_{\mathrm{inel}}(s)~, 
\end{equation}
where $s=(p_A+p_B)^2$ is the beam-beam centre-of-mass energy squared. 

\paragraph{Diffractive and non-diffractive}
If $A$ or $B$ are not elementary the inelastic final states may be
further divided into ``diffractive'' and ``non-diffractive''
topologies. This is a qualitative classification, usually based on
whether the final state looks like
the decay of an excitation of the beam particles 
(diffractive), or not (non-diffractive), or upon the presence of a
large rapidity gap somewhere in the final state which would separate such excitations.
There  are two schools of thought on how to specify this distinction more precisely: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use a theoretical model, whose 
different physics subprocesses can each be uniquely assigned as 
diffractive or non-diffractive. 
However, different models produce different final-state spectra,
and hence such a classification necessarily depends on
the model used to make it. Furthermore, if the 
model allows for events of both diffractive and non-diffractive origin
to populate the same phase space points, the
interference terms between them have no unique assignments and hence 
the classification cannot be made quantum mechanically meaningful, see
\SecRef{sec:phys-phil-behind} for a more general 
discussion of this issue. 
\item
Use one or more physical observables, which
guarantees that the definition will also be valid at the quantum level. 
In this case, the arbitrariness is instead reflected
in the fact that one has to choose what one means by a ``diffractive
topology'', at the level of a final-state observable, and this 
choice is without a unique ``correct'' answer. In general, one defines
diffractive topologies as 
events that contain large rapidity gaps in the activity,
consistent with (possibly multiple) decays of excited states, 
with ``large'' often taken to be 
somewhere in the range of 3--5 units of rapidity.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Types of diffraction}
Given that an event has been labelled as diffractive either by a
theoretical model or by a final-state observable, we may distinguish
between three different classes of diffractive topologies, which it is
possible to distinguish between physically, at least in principle. 
In double-diffractive dissociation (DD) events, both of the beam particles are
diffractively excited and hence neither of them survive the collision
intact. In single-diffractive dissociation (SD) events, only one of the beam
particles gets excited and the other survives intact. The last 
diffractive topology is  central diffraction (CD),  in which 
both of the beam particles survive intact, leaving an excited system
in the central region between them\footnote{This latter topology also includes
so-called ``central exclusive production''~\cite{Khoze:2001xm}.}.
That is, 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\mathrm{inel}}(s) = 
\sigma_{\mathrm{SD} }(s)
+
\sigma_{\mathrm{DD}}(s) +
\sigma_{\mathrm{CD}}(s) + 
\sigma_{\mathrm{ND}}(s) ~, \label{eq:diff}
\end{equation}
where ``ND'' (non-diffractive, here understood not to include elastic
scattering) contains no gaps in the event
consistent with the chosen definition of diffraction. Further, 
each of the diffractively excited systems in the events labelled SD,
DD, and CD, respectively, may in principle consist of
several subsystems with gaps between them. \EqRef{eq:diff} may 
thus be defined to be exact, within a specific definition of
diffraction, even in the presence of multi-gap events. 
Note, however, that different
theoretical models almost always use different (model-dependent) definitions of
diffraction, and therefore the individual components in one model are
in general not directly comparable to those of another. It is
therefore important that data be presented at the level of physical
observables if unambiguous conclusions are to be drawn from them, see
\SecRef{sec:phys-phil-behind} for a more detailed discussion of this issue.
Monte Carlo models of diffraction will be discussed briefly in
\SecRef{s_ue:pomerons} below.

\paragraph{Minimum bias and soft inclusive physics}
The term ``minimum bias'' is an experimental term, used to define a
certain class of events that are selected with the minimum
possible selection bias, to ensure they are as inclusive as possible. This will
be discussed in more detail in \SecRef{sec:phys-phil-behind}.
In theoretical contexts 
the term ``minimum bias'' is often used with a slightly different
meaning: to denote specific (classes of) inclusive soft QCD
subprocesses in a given model. 
Since these two usages are not exactly identical, in this review we have chosen to 
reserve the term ``minimum bias'' to pertain strictly to
definitions of experimental measurements, and instead use  
the term ``soft inclusive physics'' as a generic descriptor for the
class of processes which generally dominate the various experimental
minimum bias measurements in theoretical models.

\paragraph{Underlying event and jet pedestals} 
In events containing a hard parton-parton interaction, 
the underlying event represents the additional
activity which is not directly associated with that interaction. 
There is some ambiguity in how one defines what is
``associated'' with the hard interaction, and what is not. Here, we
shall define the underlying event to represent the additional
activity \emph{after} all bremsstrahlung off the hard interaction
has already been taken into account. Specifically, initial-state
radiation off the hard interaction is \emph{not} included in our
definition of the underlying event. Note also that the underlying
event is usually much more active, with larger fluctuations, than
 soft-inclusive collisions at the same energy. 
This is called the ``jet pedestal'' effect (hard jets sit on top of a
higher-than-average ``pedestal'' of underlying activity), and is
interpreted as follows. When two hadrons collide at non-zero impact
parameter, high-$p_\perp$ interactions can only take place  
inside the overlapping region. 
Imposing a hard selection cut therefore statistically
biases the event sample toward more central collisions, which will also
have more underlying activity. The size of the pedestal, as a function
of leading track \pt, is illustrated in
\FigsRef{fig:cmp:mpi-ue-atlas-1}--\ref{fig:cmp:mpi-ue-atlas-3} in the
comparisons section of the review (\SecRef{sec:physics-areas-where}). 

\paragraph{Multiple interactions}
In a hadron-hadron collision more than one pair of partons may
interact, leading to the possibility of multiple interactions.
In Monte Carlo modelling contexts, the most striking and easily
identifiable consequence of multiple interactions is arguably
the possibility of observing several hard parton-parton 
interactions in one and the same hadron-hadron event\footnote{
Additional jet pairs produced in this way are sometimes
referred to as ``minijets'', and theoretically belong to a class of
perturbative  corrections called ``higher twist'', but in the interest
of maintaining a compact terminology, we shall here just call them MPI
jets.}. The main distinguishing feature of such jets is that they tend to form 
back-to-back pairs, with little total \pt. For comparison, jets from 
bremsstrahlung tend to be aligned with the direction of their
``parent'' partons. The fraction of multiple interactions that give
rise to additional reconstructible jets is, however, quite small (how
small depends on the exact jet definition used). 
Additional soft interactions, below the
jet cutoff, are much more plentiful, and can give significant
corrections to the colour flow and total scattered energy 
of the event. 
This affects the final-state activity in a more global way, increasing the
multiplicity and summed transverse energy, and contributing to the
break-up of the beam remnant in the forward direction.

\caption{Models with and without MPI and parton showers, compared to

for particles with $\pt>100$~MeV, $|\eta|<2.5$, and $c\tau > 10$~mm,
in events that contain at least two such particles. \label{fig:mbnch}}
\end{figure}
To illustrate this we include in \FigRef{fig:mbnch} a comparison
between an ATLAS minimum bias measurement of the charged-track
multiplicity at 7~TeV to a Monte Carlo model with and without MPI
switched on (curves labelled as ``default'' and ``no MPI'',
respectively). Clearly, the predicted multiplicity distribution
without MPI is far too narrow, regardless of whether parton showers
are included or not (curve labelled ``no MPI, no shower''). This by
itself is one of the strongest arguments that MPI must be included in
realistic models of soft-inclusive physics.

The possibility of multiple interactions has also been implicit
or explicit in many calculations of the total hadron-hadron cross
section.  Two recent and representative examples can be found in  
 \cite{Avsar:2008dn,Grau:2009qx}.  
The increase of the parton-parton cross section with CM energy is here
directly driving an increase also of $\sigma_{\mathrm{tot}}(s)$.   

The first detailed Monte Carlo model for 
perturbative MPI was proposed by Sj\"ostrand and van Zijl in 
\cite{Sjostrand:1987su}, and most modern implementations employ a
similar physical picture. Below, in section \SecRef{sec:mbmpi}, 
we therefore first summarize the main points of this basic framework,  
pointing out the differences between the currently existing models 
as we go along. 
Some useful additional references to the history and development of
 the subject of  multiple interactions also outside the Monte Carlo context 
can be found in the Perugia MPI workshop
 proceedings \cite{Bartalini:2010su} and in the mini-reviews contained
 in \cite{Sjostrand:2004pf,Gustafson:2007sb}.
