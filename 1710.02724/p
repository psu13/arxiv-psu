- Hawking's result is then the following: for a black hole formed by gravitational collapse, and with surface gravity $\kappa$, the quantum state of the exterior is a thermal state with respect to the UP modes, at a temperature $\kappa/2\pi$. (With respect to the IN modes, the quantum state is determined by boundary conditions; for an astrophysical black hole in the current epoch, for instance, we might take the IN modes to be in a thermal state at the temperature of the microwave background radiation.)

  To understand this summary, it is helpful to describe the radiation as seen by a fictional observer hovering at a fixed distance above the black hole. Such observers move along a trajectory of constant $r,\theta,\phi$, and are often called \emph{fiducial observers}, or FIDOs. A fiducial observer at a redshift of $\alpha$ follows an accelerated worldline with locally-measured acceleration $\alpha^{-1}\mathrm{d}\alpha/\mathrm{d}r$; we can imagine the observer being held in place by a rope supported at infinity. Fiducial observers observe very different effects depending on how close they are to the event horizon:

 \item Candelas, Deutsch and Sciama (\citeNP{candelas1980}; \citeNP{sciamacandelasdeutsch}) have calculated the stress-energy tensor for a scalar field on a Schwarzschild background near to the black hole event horizon. They find that the vacuum state of that field is strongly polarised, so as to have a very large negative stress-energy density, which diverges to negative infinity on the event horizon; this negative energy density is \emph{exactly} cancelled out by the positive stress-energy density of the quanta in a thermal state at the Hawking temperature. It follows from their results that 
 \begin{enumerate}
-\item the Hartle-Hawking state, in which both UP and IN modes of the field are in that thermal state, has zero net stress-energy density close to the black hole, and so solves the semiclassical equations;
-\item any state which has any non-thermal UP mode (or any thermal UP mode at the wrong temperature) has divergent stress-energy density on the future horizon, and so fails to solve the semiclassical equations even approximately;
-\item the Unruh state, in which the UP modes are thermally excited at the Hawking temperature but the IN modes are unexcited, has singular stress-energy density on the past horizon (which, for a collapse-formed black hole, is in any case unphysical) but only mildly nonzero stress-energy density on the future horizon, so that we would expect a self-consistent solution that is only a small perturbation of the Unruh state and the Schwarzschild solution;

 \item In that small perturbation, the change in the area of the horizon can be calculated via the Newman-Penrose equation; the result is exactly in accord with the naive prediction from radiation flow. (This also gives insight into how the black hole's area can decrease in violation of the area theorem: the strongly polarised spacetime region close to the horizon allows a slight violation of the null energy condition.)

 \citeN{frolovthorne} generalised these findings to rotating black holes.
-\item Price, Thorne and Zurek (\citeNP{zurekthorne1985}; \citeNP[ch.VIII]{membraneparadigm}) translated this analysis into the membrane paradigm. In that framework, the positive stress-energy associated with the atmosphere of a black hole in the Hartle-Hawking state (\iec with both UP and IN modes thermal at the Hawking temperature) exactly cancels the negative stress-energy due to vacuum polarisation. If the IN states are unexcited, this results in a very slight depletion of the energy of the atmosphere and so a very slight negative energy flow across the stretched horizon. A precise set of conservation equations can be written at the stretched horizon that relate changes in its area to the flow of stress-energy across it; again, these reproduce exactly the naive prediction.

 \item \citeN{abdolrahimi} use numerical methods to find the metric of a radiating black hole as a perturbation of the Schwarzschild metric; they obtain a metric which far from the event horizon becomes asymptotically close to the Vaidya metric, again with the expected rate of mass decrease.
 \end{enumerate}
 In conclusion: there are excellent reasons to think that the `naive' treatment of radiation gets the facts exactly right: black hole radiation carries away energy and decreases the mass and surface area of the radiating black hole.
