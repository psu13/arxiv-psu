\begin{abstract}
Clarifying the nature of the quantum state $\ketPsi$ is at the root
of the problems with insight into (counterintuitive) quantum
postulates. We provide a direct---and math-axiom free---empirical
derivation of this object as an element of a vector space.
Establishing the linearity of this structure---quantum
superposition---is based on a set"=theoretic creation of ensemble
formations and invokes the following three principia:
(\hyperlink{I}{\red\textbf{\textsf{I}}}) quantum statics,
(\hyperlink{II}{\red\textbf{\textsf{II}}}) doctrine of a number in the
physical theory, and (\hyperlink{III}{\red\textbf{\textsf{III}}})
mathematization of matching the two observations with each other;
quantum invariance.

All of the constructs rest upon a formalization of the minimal
experimental entity: observed micro"=event, detector click. This is
sufficient for producing the $\bbC$"=numbers, axioms of linear vector
space (superposition principle), statistical mixtures of states,
eigenstates and their spectra, and non"=commutativity of observables.
No use is required of the concept of time. As a result, the
foundations of theory are liberated to a significant extent from the
issues associated with physical interpretations, philosophical
exegeses, and mathematical reconstruction of the entire quantum
edifice.

%To all appearances, contradiction between fundamental

%mathematics \cite{mermin} will always give rise to attempts to
%overcome it.
The contradiction between fundamental nature of quantum theory and
phenomenological feature of its mathematics \cite{mermin} is likely
to never cease instigating the attempts to overcome it. Expressed by
H.~Putnam's words, ``Human curiosity will not rest until \ldots\
questions [of quantum foundations] are answered''. The subject"=matter
and leitmotiv of what follows is the fact that the linear
superposition and theory's axioms are entirely empirical in origin
(demystification), and the challenges that accompany their
interpretations are a nonexistent problem coming from the ``semantic
confusion'' \cite[p.~10]{silverman} or from ``a confusion of
categories'' \cite[p.~89]{muynck}.

\subsection{On foundations of quantum theory}

The debates concerning the foundations of quantum mechanics (\qm)
hitherto ``show no sign of abating'' \cite[p.~222]{zeilinger3},
\cite{saunders, laloe}, and despite widespread scepticism
\cite{landau, faddeev, englert, gottfried, nahman, lipkin} it is
generally acknowledged that the problem is a real one
\cite{schloss3, laloe, mittel, mittel2}---it is not something made
up or ``just a dispute over words'' \cite[p.~5]{aaronson+}---and
sometimes ``has been regarded as a very serious one''
\cite[p.~418]{lipkin}, \cite{nielsen, zeilinger1}. It is worth
noting that in recent decades the discussions have even worsened
\cite{fuchs4, fuchs3}, and current research has intensified, due to
the tremendously increased and formerly inconceivable technological
possibilities of operating with individual micro"=objects and the
urge to implement the idea of quantum computing \cite{deutsch,
aaronson+}.

The reason for this state of affairs remains the same as it was
before. Unlike the classical theories---\eg, thermodynamics or
relativity theory, the \qm"=axiomatics seems wholly divorced from
human language \cite{neumann, dirac, accardi, greenstein, bell,
espagnat, home, laloe, ney, saunders, silverman, slavnov3, lipkin}.
Quantum postulates are not merely formal. They are phrased in terms
of linear operators on a complex Hilbert space $\bbH$ \cite{auletta,
ballentine2, david, gottfried, jauch1, muynck, neumann, klyshko,
landau} and there is not---literally---one word here that can be
brought into conjunction with reality by means that have at least
some kind of relationship with the classical description. What is
more, it is very well known that the abstract character of these
terms is required by the essence of the point (invariance) and, at
the same time, that the attempt to link them with physical images
leads to the famous paradoxes associated with such concepts as
causality, (non)locality, and realism \cite{zeilinger, zeilinger2,
allah, alter, ansmann, bell, fuchs1, greenberg, laloe, london,
greenstein}. All of that causes a problem with interpretations
of~\qm.

It is well known that the theory has steadfastly resisted any unique
ontological reading and, in particular, reconciliation between
interpretations. This is reflected not only in the voluminousness of
the literature. The differences in viewpoint are often based on
points of principle \cite{ballentine3, schloss2, schloss5, halat,
saunders, lipkin, nahman, fuchs2, mermin, spekkens2}, and even
highly qualified publications face criticism \cite{everett1,
lundeen, pusey, mensk}. Among other things, we encounter appeals
\cite{kampen, englert, fuchs1, accardi, mermin, aaronson, ludwig5,
schloss3} (there is even a manifest \cite{touzalin}), striking
titles such as ``scandal of quantum mechanics'' \cite{kampen2}, ``the
Oxford Questions \ldots\ to two clouds'' \cite[p.~6]{briggs}, ``quantum
mechanics for the Soviet naval officers'' \cite[p.~161]{hren1},
``Church of the Larger Hilbert Space'' (J.~Smolin) \cite{fuchs4,
englert}, and also April Fools' jokes \cite{englert2}, political
parallels with ``Marxism'' and ``the Cold War'' \cite{freire}, and many
more \cite{ballentine0, bub, laloe, mermin, stacey, stapp2,
greenstein}. An interesting fact. Cambridge University Press has
published a 500-page-long book \cite{fuchs4} containing the
remarkable electronic correspondence---D.~Mermin called it
``samizdat'' (self"=published)---between C.~Fuchs and modern
researchers and philosophers in the field of quantum foundations.
This correspondence has continued \cite[over 2300~pages]{fuchs3} and
now covers the past two decades. It characterizes the state of
affairs in the field \cite{fuchs2}(!), and does not merely add to
one's impression of the unending discussions about quantum matters
(see also introductory section in \cite{hren1}), it also, due to the
lack of formality, represents a source of ideas and of valuable
thoughts. Schlosshauer's very informative `quantum interviews'
\cite{schloss3} pursue the same goals.

The lack of transparent motivations for mathematics---a pressing
requirement of physics---means that \qm"=formalism is hard to
distinguish from a ``cook book of procedures and rituals'' (J.~Nash),
the ``user"=manual'' \cite[p.~1690]{slavnov3}, \cite{slavnov2},
\cite[p.~xiii]{greenstein}, or from ``a library of \ldots\ tricks and
intuitions'' \cite{nielsen}. Therefore the ``dissatisfaction regarding
comprehension'' and the ``need for interpretation that is alien to an
exact science'' \cite[pp.~7--8]{kadom} lead to the fact that ``we
admit, be it willingly or not, that quantum mechanics is not a
physical theory but a mathematical model'' \cite[p.~1701]{slavnov3}
or that ``nature imitates a mathematical scheme'' (Heisenberg
\cite[p.~347]{jammer}). In fact, ``we have essentially
\emph{no}\footnote{Throughout the text, the \emph{italic} and
\textsl{slanted} type in ``quotations'' is original, unless otherwise
indicated.} grasp on why the theory takes the precise structure that
it does'' \cite[p.~32]{fuchs4}, which raises the suspicion that
``something is wrong with the theory'' (H.~Putnam) and that ``this
quantum skyscraper is built on very shaky ground''
\cite[p.~8]{hren1}.

At the same time, well"=founded opinions have long been known to the
effect that ``quantum theory needs no `interpretation'\,\,''
\cite{fuchs1}, \cite{englert, kampen2, mermin} or that ``only
consequences of the basic tenets of quantum mechanics can be
verified by experiment, and not its basic laws''
\cite[p.~16]{faddeev}. In other words, the discrepancies between
opinions are significant, and often radical: from epithets such as
``schizoid\footnote{The case in point is the many-world conception by
Everett--DeWitt. See also pages~158, 161, 176--179 in \cite{dewitt}
regarding the ``state of schizophrenia'' and `explanations' as to why
``schizophrenia cannot be blamed on quantum mechanics''
\cite[p.~182]{dewitt}.}, situation is desperate''
\cite[p.~420]{lipkin}, \cite[p.~424]{pilan} to supporting the
rationale for quantum computations \cite{deutsch} and whole books
written on the subject \cite{saunders}. In any case, the controversy
between ``the warring factions, \ldots, many [quantum] faiths, \ldots\ and
instrumentalist camps'' \cite[p.~60--61]{schloss3},
\cite[sect.~5.5]{sudbery}, \cite{auletta, home} cannot be considered
an acceptable state of affairs (see also sect.~\ref{phil}), for the
simple reason that the `quantum philosophy' issues turn
into---unhealthy situation---an `industry' of interpretations, while
at the same time the very same philosophers call for its denial:
``interpretation of \qm\ emerged as a growth industry''
\cite[p.~92]{mackin}.

\subsection{Formula of superposition}\label{super}

Contrariwise, the ``dominant role of mathematics in constructing
quantum mechanics'' has lead to that mathematical ``assumptions are
usually considered to be physical'' \cite[p.~1691]{slavnov3}. That is
to say, ``there has been a substitution of concepts''
\cite[p.~295]{slavnov2} and ``one of the consequences of quantum
revolution was the replacement of explanations of physical phenomena
by their mathematical description'' \cite[p.~296]{slavnov2}. These
characteristics convey, in the best possible way, the
dissatisfaction with the fact that quantum physics ``was actually
reduced to a physical interpretation of the Hilbert space theory''
\cite[p.~1690]{slavnov3}. The $\bbH$"=space in itself is a fairly
cumbersome mathematical structure, and even determines a crucial
principle---superposition of states \cite{dirac}. It is thus not
surprising that this principle becomes ``one of the vague points \ldots\
the [Dirac] argument is difficult to consider as rational \ldots\ the
physical principle simply fits underneath it'' (excerpt from preface
to the Russian edition of~\cite{shwinger}).

Mathematics of the $\bbH$"=space contains three constituents: a
vector space, the inner"=product add-on over it, and topology. The
two latter ones invoke the first one which is completely independent
(algebra) and begins with the formula
\begin{equation}\label{1}
\ket\psi=\frak a\cdot\ket\varphi+\frak b\cdot\ket\chi\,.
\end{equation}
This is the pivotal expression of quantum theory. Comprehending its
genesis is tantamount to comprehending the nature of the linearity
of \qm. In \eqref{1}, there appear the complex numbers $\frak a,
\frak b\in\bbC$, symbols of operations $\cdot$ and~$+$, and also
vectors $\ket\psi$, $\ket\varphi$, $\ket\chi\in\bbH$. It is clear
that until an empirical basis for all these devices is found, the
interpretation of abstraction \eqref{1} and questions of the kind
``Quantum States: What the Hell Are They?'' (55~times in
\cite{fuchs3}) will remain a problem. To all appearances, the
problem is considered so difficult---``quantum states \ldots\ cannot be
`found out'\,\,'' \cite[p.~428]{saunders}---that the non"=axiomatic
meaning of these symbols was not even discussed in the literature.
In the meantime, not only is the situation far from hopeless, but it
also admits a solution. The present work is devoted to gradual
progress towards an understanding of formula \eqref{1}. Stated
differently, equality \eqref{1} becomes an \emph{empirical} theorem
(p.~\pageref{Theorem}).

\begin{itemize}
\item The main part of the challenge is not only to ascertain what
 is being added/""multiplied in \eqref{1}, but also to realize
 primarily \emph{what `to add/""multiply' is}.
\end{itemize}
Moreover, besides the symbols $\{\frak a$, $\frak b$, $\ket\psi$,
$\ket\varphi$, $\ket\chi$, $\cdot\,$, $+\}$ the expression \eqref{1}
contains the sign of equality $=$ (see also \cite{mazur},
\cite[p.~29--30]{baez+}) and, surprising as it may seem, it conceals
one of the key points---the 3-rd principium of quantum theory
(\hyperlink{III}{\red\textbf{\textsf{III}}}, p.~\pageref{III}).

The guiding observation is based on the fact that the only thing
that we have access to are the microscopic events, and therefore ``we
have little to begin with other than what an experimental physicist
would call experiments with a single microsystem''
\cite[p.~5]{ludwig1}. Consequently, we must begin from them and from
collecting them into ensemble formations. It is precisely in this
context that we will use the word empiricism---quantum empiricism of
micro-acts---and it is in this respect that quantum theory has a
statistical nature; as predicted by Einstein\footnote{A.~Einstein:
``It may be a correct theory of statistical laws, but an inadequate
conception of individual elementary processes'' \cite[p.~156]{home};
see also \cite[pp.~38--40]{einstein}.} \cite[Chs.~7--8]{home} and
von~Neumann \cite{neumann, stacey}, long championed by Ballentine
\cite{ballentine} and justified in detail by Ludwig \cite{ludwig1,
ludwig2, ludwig3, ludwig4}. A.~Leggett proposes in this regard the
``extreme statistical interpretation'' \cite{leggett1},
\cite[p.~79]{schloss3} and remarks clearly that ``to seek any further
``meaning'' in the formalism is pointless and can only generate
pseudoquestions''. With that, he overtly adds such characteristics as
``complete gibberish'' \cite[p.~70]{leggett1} and ``verbal window
dressing'' \cite[p.~79]{schloss3}. The difficulty is, of course, in
creating the object $\ket\psi$ itself. A step-by-step
characterization of this procedure
(sects.~\ref{Ans}--\ref{statespace}) and key words to what follows
are reflected in the (sub)section titles listed in the Contents.

\subsection{Physics {\smaller[2]$\rightleftarrows$}
mathematics. Doctrine of numbers}\label{physmath}

Thus the situation appears to be one whereby the mathematical
superstructures are difficult to reconcile with physical motivations
(physical principles) \cite{benioff}, while attempts to axiomatize
an interface between them \cite{hart} only conceal a deeper insight
\cite{zeilinger1}. T.~Maudlin: ``\ldots\ physicists have been misled by
the mathematical language they use to represent the physical world''.
In other words, we observe an overemphasis on the role of the
`ready"=made' math"=structures and an under"=evaluation of (`seemingly
na\"ive') empirical considerations.

What we propose below is an implementation of the idea that such a
view must be abandoned and replaced by a negation of the prior
existence of both physical ``preconceived notions''
\cite[p.~328]{ludwig2} and mathematical structures. Physics and
mathematics should be created `from scratch'. Paul Benioff calls
this ``a coherent theory of physics and mathematics''
\cite[p.~639]{benioff}. Then, due to the initial absence of
mathematics, the introduction of mathematical structures is almost
ruled out, proofs must yield to empirical inference, and the physics
language---the language of physical reasoning---is initially under a
linguistic ban whatsoever. It cannot exist a~priori. That is to say,
even the natural"=language conjunction of terms with physical
adjectives (and verbs \cite{hartle2}) becomes far from being free,
as with the classical description's language (sects.~\ref{S},
\ref{SS}, \ref{phys}, \ref{2slit}). The ensemble formations have to
come to the fore and argumentation should be subordinated only to
the low"=level microscopic empiricism.
%а, скажем, не тому факту, что некая математическая теорема поможет
%решить физическую проблему.
This immediately touches on its closest creature---the notion of a
number, since numbers do not come `from the sky', and the theory
will have to be a quantitative one. Despite the overflow of
abstracta in \qm"=theory, the \emph{doctrine of
number}---$\lceil$num\-ber$\:\times\:$unit$\rceil$, to be precise
(sect.~\ref{Numbers}, \ref{minus})---has likely not yet got into
foundational discussions \cite{gryb}. Consequently, the numbers turn
into a kind of `problem of numbers'
(principium~\hyperlink{II}{\red\textbf{\textsf{II}}}) and a substantial
part of what follows is devoted to this.

In outline, the workflow will constitute the re"=creating the
structure of a linear vector space\footnote{More precisely,
producing a mathematics, which will found to be an algebra of such a
space.}, and all the subsequent ideology can be schematized as
follows.
\begin{equation*}

\end{equation*}
This scheme cannot be reduced or restructured.

By and large, the aforesaid ideology is supported by the common
belief---often certainty even \cite{englert}---that \qm\ is
\emph{not} perturbative, its linearity is \emph{not} associated with
linear approximation of something else, and that in general, it is
\emph{not} extensible (ultimate \cite{colbeck}) and must be free of
interpretations \cite{englert, fuchs1}. All of these concerns, in
one way or another, are directly related to derivation of
formula~\eqref{1}.

\smallskip

Since empiricism is in essence supra"=mathematical \cite{bueno}, \ie,
it is concerned with \emph{meta}\-mathe\-matics \cite{kleene, raseva},
its mathematization---theory construction---should begin not with
postulates and definitions, but with the formation of an object
language, of vocabulary, and ``may only be described by ``words'' and
not by a theory'' \cite[p.~106]{ludwig1}, \cite{ludwig3, ludwig5}. As
A.~Peterson had observed, ``Math can never be used in phys until have
words'' \cite[p.~209]{barrett}. Therefore, relying on the established
understanding of the underlying causes for the quantum eye on
physical observation \cite{neumann, auletta, gottfried, greenstein},
up until the end of this section we will adopt the natural"=language
meaning of the words observation, system, state, numbers, physical
influence, transition, large/small, micro/macro, \etc. Their
contents will later be defined more precisely or entirely changed.
For instance, the meaning of the word `state' will be radically
transformed, to which we are drawing attention in advance.
Accordingly, a degree of informality, clarified on
page~\pageref{meta} and in Remark~\ref{meta}, is inevitable here.

\subsection{Variations as micro-level transitions}\label{S}

We will (and `must' \cite[Ch.~3]{kleene}) first view the concept of
a system at an intuitive level \cite[sect.~1.1]{edwards}: there is
what is referred to as (isolated) system~$\cal S$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[\hypertarget{S}{\red\textsf{S}}] Let us tentatively (a~priori)
 relate the concept of a \emph{state} to the associated context
 described by the words `the system $\cal S$ can be
 \emph{different}, or \emph{in different states}'. That is to say,
 system $\cal S$ is always in a certain state $\statePsi$ belonging
 to the set $\boT=\{\statePsi,\statePhi,\ldots\}$, each element of
 which is admissible for $\cal S$, and all of them are different
 from each other: $\statePsi\ne\statePhi$.
\end{itemize}
The statement ``states are different'' does not require a
consideration when $\statePsi$ and $\statePhi$, referred to as
state, are the abstract elements of an abstract set
$\{\statePsi,\statePhi,\ldots\}$. However, in order to tie its elements
to reality, we have to introduce the criteria of
coincidence/""distinguishability of one from the other. Criteria may
come exclusively from observational procedures, without which it is
impossible to either detect states, or claim that they differ,
coincide, exist or that they actually occur.

On the other hand, the nature of micro"=phenomena shows that
observations are always associated with irreducible intervention in
the system, manifesting in what is known as \emph{transition}
$\statePsi\rightsquigarrow\statePsi'$ (or destruction\footnote{As an
example, observations at accelerators are literally the
destructions, and mass at that.}). Due to a lack of criteria, there
is no sense in attributing adjectives small/large,
(in)significant/""partial, or collocations like `comparison of
destructions at instants $t_1$, $t_2$' to this concept. Let us
proceed from the idea that initially there is nothing but the
transition. Transitions may actually occur without destructions
$\statePsi\rightsquigarrow\statePsi$, however.

Two different $\statePsi$, $\statePhi$ may be destroyed into new
$\statePsi'$, $\statePhi'$, as well as into the combinations of
old/new. Thus, strictly speaking, the meaning of words `different,
new, \ldots' eludes us in this case, which is why even the
identification of $\statePsi$"=elements and the $\boT$ itself, as a
set, become questionable. Therefore, besides the formal writings
$\statePsi=\statePhi$ and $\statePsi\ne\statePhi$ for
$\statePsi,\statePhi\in\boT$, the \emph{physical}
distinguishability/""equivalence (recognizability
${\not\approx}{/}{\approx}$) needs to be established. As to the
identity in this regard, see von~Neumann's reasoning ``One might
object against \textsf{II} \ldots'' on page~302 of his book \cite{neumann}.
The sole thing that distinguishability may rely on are the
transition acts. In turn, variation is a key element in transitions,
that is why we will begin constructing with distinguishability.

Let us take the still virtually unlimited way $\scr A$ of
intervening $\TRANS{\sss\scr A}$ in $\cal S$, and attempt to
introduce distinguishability $\statePsi\not\approx\statePhi$ as
$\scr A$"=distinguishability. Due to the fact that micro"=transition
$\statePsi\TRANS{\sss\scr A}\statePsi'$ is not pre"=determined,
initial states $\statePsi$ undergo arbitrarily free changes. Next
time, the results will be different and absolutely arbitrary (the
term ``different'' is understood to be $\ne$), and each act is
indiscernible from a case in which it contains ones similar to
itself within itself. It would be natural to associate such a case
to the absurd, which is unrelated to the meaning of the words
`physical observation', and to discard the given $\scr A$.

Non"=meaninglessness arises only if we impose the negation of random
combinations of $\ne$ and $=$ in transitions, at least for a part of
$\boT$, \ie, introduce the preservation acts
$\statePsi\TRANS{\sss\scr A}\statePsi$. The `preservation' should be
read here as indestructibility of state, \ie, as a ($=$)"=coincidence
under the secondary act
$\statePsi\rightsquigarrow\statePsi\rightsquigarrow\statePsi$.
Otherwise, the vanishing difference between `preservation' and
`variation' leads to a linguistic chaos \cite[p.~232]{foulis}. This
means that the destruction $\statePsi\rightsquigarrow\statePsi'$ may
not be considered as a 1-fold one. State $\statePsi'$ on the right
should be examined for changeability and transform into the left
part of the subsequent transition:
$\statePsi\rightsquigarrow\statePsi'\rightsquigarrow\statePsi''$.
Thereby, the structure $\statePsi'\rightsquigarrow\statePsi''$ with
the \emph{binate} entity `before/""after' or `on the left/right'
becomes the key one, and we consider it an initial object in
subsequent constructs. Preserved states are, by definition, those
that pass the reproducibility test.

Thus logic requires to begin with the transition compositions
\begin{equation*}
\statePsi\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\statePsi'
\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\statePsi''
\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\cdots\,,
\end{equation*}
wherein the cases like
\begin{equation}\label{nons}
\statePsi'
\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\statePsi'
\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\statePsi''
\end{equation}
are ruled out (a ban on changing of what has been unchanged), and
the never"=ending sequence
\begin{Align}\label{chaos}
&\statePsi\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\statePsi'
\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\cdots \TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}
\statePsi''\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\cdots
\intertext{(non"=recognisability of states) must be terminated}
\label{seq} &\statePsi\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\statePsi'
\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\cdots\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}
\statePsi''\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\state\alpha
\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\state\alpha\,,
\end{Align}
yielding a `finiteness' (\,$=$~the realistic) and the concept of
conserved/""distinctive $\state\alpha$"=states. The terminology
$\state\alpha$"=event \cite{englert} could be used instead.

Freedom of elements in sequence~\eqref{seq}, including the choice of
$\state\alpha$"=states, is not limited by anything besides the ban
on~\eqref{nons}. Therefore this arbitrariness, which is physically
never recognizable, curtails the generic chain \eqref{seq} into the
shortened one
\begin{equation}\label{box}
\def\fboxsep{1.5\dimen36}
\statePsi\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}
\boxed{\cdots\cdots}\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\state\alpha
\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\state\alpha\,,
\end{equation}
which is identical to the scheme
\begin{equation}\label{Box}
\def\fboxsep{0.8\dimen36}
\boxed{\cdots\statePsi\cdots}\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}
\state\alpha\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\state\alpha
\end{equation}
with certain $\state\alpha\in\boT$.

Discussions on ``how'' and ``what happens'' \cite[p.~217]{neumann} at
the very microscopic level are extremely widespread in the
literature \cite{greenberg, alter, kampen, london, lundeen, mittel,
kadom} (see \cite{allah, auletta, schloss4, mittel2} for the
exhaustive references), although it is not difficult to predict the
fact that the attempts to understand the inner structure of
box~\eqref{Box} will only lead back to an identical box.

Actually, the uncontrollability of micro"=changes is universally
known, yet describing them as a process in time $t\mapsto t+\eps$
will start employing the language terminology---functions,
arithmetic operations, \etc---that has not yet been created even for
the fixed instants $t_1$, $t_2$. However, what may be associated
with fixed time are only non"=temporal entities, for which we have
nothing but transitions~\eqref{box}. The attempt to manage them,
\ie, to control intervention in $\cal S$, leads to looping or
`measuring the measurement', let alone the ambiguity of the term
itself.
\begin{quote}
G.~Ludwig: ``it is not meaningful to speak of a measurement ``at time
$\tilde t$.'' \ldots\ the real physical meaning of the time parameter
\ldots\ has nothing to do with the notion ``time of measurement.''''
\cite[p.~288]{ludwig1}. ``[T]he description of the measurement
process in quantum mechanics in terms of ``pre"=theories'' is not
possible'' \cite[p.~340]{ludwig2}.
\end{quote}
See also \cite[p.~365]{ludwig2}, \cite[p.~150]{ludwig4},
\cite[p.~100]{ludwig5}, \cite[p.~644--646]{peres0}. Just as before,
the physical assessments like `abrupt', `(ir)re\-versible',
'(non)si\-mul\-ta\-ne\-ous', ``immediately following \ldots,'' \cite[p.~231,
410]{neumann}, or `weak/""nondemolishing' (measurements
\cite{lundeen}), \etc\ are unacceptable here. No temporal process
may be present in the foundations of the theory
\cite[sects.~VII.4,~6]{ludwig1}, \cite[Chs.~III, XVII]{ludwig2},
\cite{ludwig3}, since it is not immediately clear `And what exactly
are we having at instants $t_1$ or~$t_2$?'.

\begin{comment}
All said above means that attempts to deduce \qm\ dynamically
\cite[10~$\bo\cdot$~Re\-construc\-tions]{schloss3} are beforehand
doomed to vicious circles `round the boxes' and time $t$ like
attempts to `vindicate' dynamically Lorenz's contraction instead of
kinematic postulates of the relativity theory \cite{bub}. Consistent
theory must rest either on `irreducible' elements \eqref{Box} or
upon `boxes' of a different kind. In the latter case, the theory
becomes a particular \emph{model with interpretation}; \eg, the
Lindblad equations \cite{weinberg, weinberg2}, decoherence
\cite{joos, zurek, schloss4, schloss}, stochastic dynamics, and
other statistic"=dynamical models \cite{allah, kadom}. Anyway, an
ability to model and understanding are not the same thing, and this
point, with regard to quantum theory, was repeatedly emphasized in
the literature \cite{slavnov3}, \cite{schloss3}.
\end{comment}

Now, if theory is built \emph{as a fundamental one, rather than as a
model} \cite[p.~144]{schloss3}, with primary entity
\emph{changeability} $\TRANS{\sss\scr A}$, a box \eqref{Box} may
only be involved in it as the initial starting point and as an
\emph{indescribable}\label{bbox} object with the absolute rather than
with a relative sense. Elements of reality, in whatever
understanding---say, Bell's `beables' \cite{bell})---may not exist
before/""after/""inside/""outside of the box. It can be only
\emph{structureless abstractio}. Accordingly, the notions of
preparation, of measurement, of `interaction with', and of a
physical process are meaningless without construction \eqref{Box}.
These statements are clearly in agreement with the fact that any
reasoning must not contradict the formal logical rules
\cite{kleene}, hence, there must exist \cite{raseva, shenfield,
benioff} the empirically undefinable logical atoms. A.~Peres writes
\cite[p.~173]{peres}: ``While quantum theory can in principle
describe \textsl{anything}, a quantum description cannot include
\textsl{everything}. In every physical situation \textsl{something} must
remain unanalyzed''. Or, as Pauli put it, ``Like the ultimate fact
without any cause, the individual outcome of a measurement is \ldots\
not comprehended by laws''. In particular, the set $\boT$ and
transitions"=arrows~$\TRANS{\sss\scr A}$ are also the atoms. Englert:
``\ldots\ preexisting concept \ldots\ We cannot formulate the theory
without this concept'' \cite[p.~2]{englert}. From the aforesaid, we
may formulate the following observation.
\begin{itemize}
\item[\hypertarget{I}{{\red\textbf{\textsf{I}}}}] Quantum statics should
 precede quantum dynamics.\\ (\hbox{\embf{the $\bo1$-st principium
 of quantum theory}})
\end{itemize}

The rationales do not end here, and will be later amplified once we
begin to exploit the terminology that is usually taken for granted
from the outset; namely, the quantitative descriptions
\cite[p.~178]{fuchs4}. If they arise not as numeric interpretations
of something, but out of an experiment, then observation should be
the beginning, and the `manufacture of numbers'---the end. In other
words, the model `theory with boxes' other than
\eqref{box}--\eqref{Box} implicitly implies the logical sequence
$\lceil$mo\-del of process $\rightarrowtail$ numeric
in\-ter\-pre\-ta\-tion$\rceil$, where empiricism holds a role other than
primary. It is clear that, regardless of the model, such a situation
will always remain unsatisfactory in the physical respect.

\subsection{Observation}\label{observ}

The sequences addressed above lead to the following outcome.
\begin{itemize}
\item Any meaningful micro-act $\TRANS{\sss\scr A}$ either saves a
 state ($\state\alpha\TRANS{\sss\scr A}\state\alpha$) or turns it
 into a conserved one ($\statePsi\TRANS{\sss\scr A}\state\alpha$).
\end{itemize}
The two extremes do not contradict this fact. The first---maximally
rough observations---is when all states are destroyed into a certain
one: $\statePsi \rightsquigarrow \statePsi_0$ (`whatever and however
we watch, all we see is one and the same'). In this, the state
$\statePsi_0$ is not destroyed: $\statePsi_0 \rightsquigarrow
\statePsi_0$. Another extreme is when none of the states are
destroyed: $\statePsi \rightsquigarrow \statePsi$. This is the case
of ideal (quantum) observation, but, due to the absence of any
changes, it is indistinguishable from the case of if observations
are entirely absent.

A case with two distinctive states
\begin{equation}\label{a1122}
\state\alpha_1\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\state\alpha_1\,,\qquad
\state\alpha_2\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\state\alpha_2
\end{equation}
is the simplest among these extremes. Of course, the
$\state\alpha$'s are prohibited from transitioning into each other.
Because there is still the free admissibility of transitions
$\statePsi\TRANS{\sss\scr A}\state\alpha_1$,
$\statePsi\TRANS{\sss\scr A}\state\alpha_2$, we can turn the
semantic sequence
\begin{equation*}
\big\lceil\text{arbitrariness}\quad\rightarrowtail\quad\text{preservation}\quad
\rightarrowtail\quad\text{distinctive $\state\alpha$'s}\big\rceil
\end{equation*}
into the more rigorous scheme
\begin{equation}\label{shema}
\Big\lgroup\boT=\{\statePsi\,,\,\statePhi\,,\,\ldots\}\;+\;\scr A
\text{-observations}\Big\rgroup\quad\rightarrowtail\quad
\{\state\alpha_1\,,\state\alpha_2\,,\ldots\}\FED \boT_{\!\sss\scr A}
\subset\boT\,,
\end{equation}
which gives, even though partially, rise to the concept of a
physical distinguishability (`distinguo'). It is formally defined
only on the subset $\boT_{\!\sss\scr A}$: the statement
$\state\alpha_1\not\approx\state\alpha_2$ is equivalent
to~\eqref{a1122}. To avoid overloading the further notation, we do
not use symbols like $\approx_{\!\!\!\sss\scr A}$ and
$\not\approx_{\!\!\!\sss\scr A}$; the context is always obvious.
\begin{itemize}
\item[\hypertarget{O}{{\red\textsf{O}}}] By a \emph{physical
 observation} $\scr A$ or, in short, \emph{observation} we will mean
 such interventions\footnote{More comprehensive terminology:
 micro-act of observation by instrument $\scr A$. The zig-zag arrow
 $\TRANS{}$ is replaced with the straight one $\GOTO{}$.}
 $\GOTO{\sss\scr A}$, in which the `never"=ending' chaos
 \eqref{chaos} is replaced by a chaos with the notion of a
 preservation, \ie, `chaos with rule~\eqref{Box}':
 \begin{equation}\label{rule}
 \statePsi\GOTO[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\state\alpha\,\quad\text{and~ }\quad
 \state\alpha\GOTO[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\state\alpha\,.
 \end{equation}
 The set of $\state\alpha$"=objects $\boT_{\!\sss\scr A}$ with the
 property
 \begin{equation}\label{akk}
 \state\alpha_1\GOTO[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\state\alpha_1\,,\qquad
 \state\alpha_2\GOTO[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\state\alpha_2\,,\qquad\ldots
 \end{equation}
 is discrete, and the $\state\alpha_s$ themselves are termed
 \emph{the eigen \emph{(proper)} for observation $\scr A$}. They
 defines $\scr A$ and do not depend on $\cal S$. No logical
 connection between $\statePsi$ (the left of \eqref{rule}), family
 $\boT_{\!\sss\scr A}$, and system $\cal S$ exists.
\end{itemize}
Expressed another way, introduction of the conception `the eigen' is
equivalent to the following informal, yet minimal motivation:
\emph{at least some} certainty instead of \emph{total}
arbitrariness.

Two instruments $\scr A$ and $\scr B$ may have arbitrarily different
eigen"=states $\{\state\alpha_1$, \ldots, $\state\alpha_n\}$ $\ne$
$\{\state\beta_1,\ldots,\state\beta_m\}$. Accordingly, as regards
observation $\scr B$, the (distinctive) states $\{\state\alpha_s\}$
do not differ, in general, from the `regular' $\statePsi$'s, \ie,
from those chaotically destroyable into the $\scr B$"=eigen states
$\state\beta_k$. All kinds of instruments $\scr A$, $\scr B$, \ldots\
are thus defined by aggregates $\boT_{\!\sss\scr A}$,
$\boT_{\!\sss\scr B}$, \ldots. The number $|\boT_{\!\sss\scr A}|$ of
corresponding $\state\alpha$"=objects therein may be an arbitrary
integer. There are also no (logical) grounds for
restricting/""prescribing the composition of $\boT_{\!\sss\scr A}$. Any
element of $\boT$ may be the conserved one for a certain instrument.
Parenthetically, the notion of eigen"=state---in different forms---is
sometimes present in axiomatics of \qm\ \cite{piron, beltrametti,
mittel}.

In a generic case, the chaos present in~\eqref{rule} leaves open the
problem of correlating the recognizability
$\statePsi\not\approx\statePhi$ (or $\statePsi\approx\statePhi$)
with physics. Clearly, the issue is linked to the ambiguity of the
term $\statePsi$"=state itself, which is used in
pt.~\hyperlink{S}{\red\textsf{S}}---an important point---due to the
need to start with something, since building the mathematical
description without some sort of a set is impossible.

\begin{comment}\label{two}
Informally, metalinguistic semantics---association of meanings with
texts \cite{ludwig5}---is in general as follows. Inasmuch as we are
receiving \emph{different} $\state\alpha$"=responses to each
micro-act $\GOTO{\sss\scr A}$, let us say that `on the other side
from us there is something that can also be different, and all of
that is to be described'. This reflects our intuitive perception of
reality, which, both at micro- and macro"=level, boils down to an
ineradicable pair: $\lceil$some\-thing out\-side$\rceil$~$+$
$\lceil$that which can be different for us$\rceil$
(pt.~\hyperlink{S}{\red\textsf{S}}). If we give up either of these
conceptual premises---`something outside' ($\statePsi$) and `can be
different' ($\state\alpha_j$)---then, as above, we face a linguistic
dead end, as the basis for discourse disappears. There must be
present two sides. Because of this the arrow $\GOTO{\sss\scr A}$
must be accompanied by `some thing' to the left and the right of it.
The low"=level set $\boT=\{\statePsi$, $\statePhi$, \ldots,
$\state\alpha_1$, $\state\alpha_2$, \ldots\} does arise. Then the
arbitrary elements $\statePsi\in\boT$ (unrestricted chaos) are
assigned to the left of this act instead of `some thing', and the
micro $\not\approx$"=distinguishable $\state\alpha$"=objects
($\state\alpha_j\not\approx\state\alpha_s$)---to the right. Put
another way,
\begin{itemize}
\item what's being abstracted is not ``concrete things''
 \cite[p.~27]{gottfried} but a primitive element of
 perception---micro"=event $\state\alpha$"=click\footnote{As to these
 `qualia', see answers of \v{C}.~Brukner (!) on pp.~41--43 in
 \cite{schloss3}, his work \cite[p.~98]{brukner}, the page~635 in
 \cite{zeilinger1}, and the work \cite{ulfbeck}.}. Other than `the
 click', no any entities---like very small objects, particles,
 fields, or, much less knowledge, human psychology/""memory
 \cite{everett, everett1}, ``mysterious interaction \ldots brain of the
 observer \ldots'' \cite[p.~645]{peres0}, agents and their
 belief/""consciousness \cite{mensk, tegmark, stapp2}, \etc---may
 exist in empiricism. The click is a kind of experimental the
 0"=principium of \qm. Therefore the initial mathematical premises of
 \qm"=theory should contain nothing but the
 $\not\approx_{\!\!\!\sss\scr A}$"=distinguishability and formalization
 \eqref{rule}--\eqref{akk}.
\end{itemize}

It may be added that the micro"=observation, as such, is terminated
at the eigen elements; one and the same $\state\alpha_j$ has always
remained on the right.
\end{comment}

As a result, the minimal experimental entity
$\statePsi\GOTO{\sss\scr A}\state\alpha$ constitutes,
mathematically, an ordered pair $(\statePsi,\state\alpha_j)$ of
elements of the set~$\boT$, which are labeled by the symbol~$\scr A$
that is equivalent to the $\boT_{\!\sss\scr A}$"=family~\eqref{shema}.
Accordingly, the customary physical notion of the observation is
substituted for a micro"=event, an act. `Physics should forget about
processes or time of interaction when observing' and about anything
but $\statePsi\GOTO{\sss\scr A}\state\alpha$.

\subsection{Numeric realizations}\label{makenumb}

Is there a possibility to rely exclusively on the inflexibility of
the eigen"=type elements~\eqref{akk}? Or to define the sought-for
ultimate distinguishability~$\not\approx$ through the
$\scr A$-(micro)distinguishabilities
$\state\alpha_j\not\approx_{\!\!\!\sss\scr A}\state\alpha_s$? Let us
formulate a thesis.
\begin{itemize}
\item[\hypertarget{T}{{\red\textsf{T}}}] There is no (linguistic) means
 of recognizing the system $\cal S$ to be different
 (pt.~\hyperlink{S}{\red\textsf{S}}), other than through the results of
 its destructions into the $\{\state{\alpha}_1$, $\state{\alpha}_2$,
 \ldots\}"=objects of observational instruments $\scr A$.
\end{itemize}
To be sure, the stringency of this linguistic taboo
(\hyperlink{T}{\red\textsf{T}}) must be accompanied by something
constructive, and we will adopt the following programme that
reflects the fact that the unequivocal description may take only the
form of a quantitative mathematical theory.
\begin{itemize}
\item[\hypertarget{R}{{\red\textsf{R}}}] $\phantom{\bullet}(\bullet)$ Out of the
 primary (`proto')elements $\{\statePsi,\state\alpha,\ldots\}\in\boT$,
 one constructs a new set $\bbH$, of which the elements
 \begin{equation}\label{Repr}
 \ket\Xi\DEF
 {\bo\Oplus}(\frak a_1,\ket{\alpha_1};\frak a_2,\ket{\alpha_2};
 \ldots) \in \bbH
 \end{equation}
 are said to be (numeric) \emph{representations} in the `reference
 frame for instrument $\scr A$', and $\frak a_s$ are the numeric
 objects. The distinguishability relation
 $\not\approx_{\!\!\!\sss\scr A}$ is carried over to $\bbH$ and admits
 an $\frak a$"=coordinate realization there; symbol~$\not\approx$.\\
 $(\bullet\bullet)$~No preferential or preordained observational reference frame
 $\scr A\{\state\alpha_1,\state\alpha_2,\ldots\}$---`instrument the
 absolute'---exists.
\end{itemize}

Identification \eqref{Repr} is always tied to a certain family
$\boT_{\!\sss\scr A}$. Accordingly, images of
$\state\alpha_s$---symbols $\ket{\alpha_s}$---will be present in
\eqref{Repr}, and character $\bo\Oplus$ is also no more than a
symbol here. Even though coordinates $\frak a_s$ are declared to be
numbers or aggregates of numbers, there is no arithmetic stipulated
for them yet. The number is as yet a name for $\frak a_s$.
Distinguishability $\ketPsi\not\approx\ket{{}\tilde{\bo\Psi}}$ of
two representatives
\begin{equation*}
{\bo\Oplus}(\frak a_1,\ket{\alpha_1};\frak a_2,\ket{\alpha_2};
\ldots)\FED\ketPsi\,,\qquad{\bo\Oplus}(\tilde{\frak a}_1,\ket{\alpha_1};
\tilde{\frak a}_2,
\ket{\alpha_2};\ldots)\FED\ket{{}\tilde{\bo\Psi}}
\end{equation*}
by means of numbers $\frak a_k\ne\tilde{\frak a}_k$ and mathematical
implementation of \eqref{Repr} and of the $\bbH$"=space, \ie, a
`coordinatization' scheme, have yet to be established. This will
comprise the meaning of the word `constructs'
(sects.~\ref{Numbers}--\ref{statespace}), which may not be even
linked to the mathematical term mapping yet, since \emph{no math of
\qm\ exists at the moment}. It immediately follows that the question
about numeric entities---specifically, about \eqref{Repr}---is
nontrivial in physics.
\begin{itemize}
\item[\hypertarget{II}{{\red\textbf{\textsf{II}}}}] To speak of an exact
 correspondence between empiricism and mathematics makes no sense
 until the \emph{mechanism of emergence} of that which\look[?what]
 is understood by number\footnote{What an empiricist/""observer
 understands by the word `number'. The underlying message here
 implies that the reliance upon the all"=too"=familiar abstract
 arithmetic elucidates nothing. \emph{There is no arithmetic in
 interferometers/""colliders}---there are only clicks there---and
 empirical nature of arising this construction (along with the
 measurement) must be scrutinized.} has been detailed.
 (\hbox{\embf{the $\bo2$-nd principium of quantum theory}})
\end{itemize}
From pts.~\hyperlink{T}{\red\textsf{T}}, \hyperlink{R}{\red\textsf{R}},
and \hyperlink{II}{\red\textbf{\textsf{II}}} it also follows that the
search for a description through hidden variables, over which
something is averaged, is indistinguishable from the utopian
attempts to find out an intrinsic content of boxes~\eqref{box}.

\subsection{Macro and micro}\label{MM}

The task becomes more precise at this point. Instead of nonphysical
identity/""noncoincidence ($\statePsi=\statePhi$ or
$\statePsi\ne\statePhi$) of two abstract elements $\statePsi$,
$\statePhi$ of the abstract set $\boT$, we need the concept of a
physical $\Approx$"=equivalence ($\not\Approx$"=distinguishability) of
$\bbH$"=representatives $\{\ketPsi$, $\ketPhi$, \ldots\}. That is, there
must hold either relation $\ketPsi\Approx\ketPhi$ or its negation
$\ketPsi\not\Approx\ketPhi$ for all $\ketPsi,\ketPhi\in\bbH$. The
primitive set $\boT$, initially required by
point~\hyperlink{S}{\red\textsf{S}}, must disappear from the ultimate
mathematics of symbols $\ketPsi\in\bbH$. Therefore elements
$\statePsi\in\boT$ are henceforth named \emph{primitives}. In
summary,
\begin{itemize}
\item There is no a~priori way to endow the term (quantum) state of
 system $\cal S$ with any meaning \cite[p.~419]{lipkin}. This
 concept should be created. It may not have a definition. Meanwhile,
 one cannot get around the concept of a (micro)observation $\scr A$
 \cite[pp.~98--100]{brukner}, \cite[p.~646]{peres0}, \cite{benioff,
 ballentine2}. Essentially, no one thing, including $\statePsi$,
 $\state\alpha$, or the $\boT$"=set itself, can be the primary bearer
 of data about~$\cal S$.
\end{itemize}
The notions of a physical observable and of its observable values
\cite[p.~5]{ludwig1} are also ambiguous at this point. Their
ambiguity is even greater than that of state, due to questions like
`what is being measured?' and even `what is a measurement?'.
Nonetheless, up until the end of this section, we will not discard
the term state within the context of pt.~\hyperlink{S}{\red\textsf{S}}.

Irreproducibility of outcomes, \ie, `turnability of
$\statePsi$"=primitives into the various' leaves only one option: `to
take a look at $\cal S$ again, once again, \ldots'. In other words, to
seek the source of description in repeatability. It is necessary,
then, to move to the subject of macro-, rather than
micro"=observation. This intention fits perfectly with the undefined
verb `constructs' in pt.~\hyperlink{R}{\red\textsf{R}}, and the
following paradigm should be understood as the macro.

\begin{itemize}
\item[\hypertarget{M}{{\red\textsf{M}}}] The only way of handling the
 uncontrollable micro"=level changes is the consideration of the
 results of repeated destructions, accompanied by what we shall call
 the common physical macro"=environment (experimental context):
 \begin{equation}\label{macro}
 \scr A\![9]
 \array{r@{}c@{}c@{}cc@{}c@{}cc@{}l}
 &\statePsi &\;\;\cdots\;\;& \statePsi &\statePsi&\;\;
 \cdots\;\;&\statePsi&\cdots&\cdots\\
 &\DOWN&\DOWN&\DOWN&\DOWN&\DOWN&\DOWN&\DOWN\\
 &\state\alpha_1 &\cdots& \state\alpha_1&\state\alpha_2
 &\cdots&\state\alpha_2&\cdots&\cdots
 \endarray\hspace{-1.7em}\scr A\qquad{}+\quad
 \lceil\textup{common macro-environment\ }\ \mbf M\rceil\,.
 \end{equation}
\end{itemize}
An importance of repetitions and distinguishability had long been
noted (Bohr, von~Neumann et~ al \cite{jammer}) and recently it was
particularly emphasized in the work \cite{zurek0}. The words
`co\-py/""re\-peat\ldots\!\!\!/distin\ldots' occur 90 times therein.

Thus empiricism of quantum statics forces us to operate exclusively
with such formations of copies $\state\alpha$, \ldots, $\statePsi$, and
this is the maximum amount of data provided by the
supra"=mathematical problem setup. \emph{All} further mathematical
structures may come only from constructions like \eqref{macro} and
from nothing else. Getting ahead of ourselves, let us turn our
attention to the fact that implementation of this idea \emph{is not
short"=length}---``the mathematization process (cor) is not simple''
\cite[p.~24]{ludwig5}, and sects.~\ref{Ans}--\ref{minus} are devoted
specifically to this idea.

One can once again repeat (sect.~\ref{physmath}) that much of what
follows does not and cannot contain the mathematical proofs as they
are usually present in the literature on quantum foundations.
Instead, there appears the step-by-step \emph{inference} of objects
as they result themselves: numbers, operations, groups, algebras,
\etc. The only instrument that may be applicable here is the
empirical inference.

The common macro"=environment $\mbf M$ in \eqref{macro} is also
considered as a supra"=mathematical notion \cite{raseva}, the
mathematical implementation of which is yet to be created. The same
considerations regarding qualitative adjectives are applicable as to
the physical convention $\mbf M$ as well as the transition acts in
sect.~\ref{S}. Representations \eqref{Repr} are the formalization of
the meaning $\lceil$ob\-ser\-va\-tion~$+$ data on system
$\cal S$$\rceil$, but now with no references to the elementary acts
in \eqref{macro}. The physical distinguishability criteria
$\ketPsi\not\Approx\ketPhi$ may not be formulated yet (physical
attributes are not yet available), but $\ket{\alpha_s}$"=elements
have already appeared in \eqref{Repr} as prototypes of explicitly
distinguishable~$\state\alpha_s$.

\begin{comment}
Dual form of the typical quantum statements like `$\cal S$ is a
\emph{micro}"=system and $\scr A$"=instrument is a
\emph{macro}"=object' (Bohr) is identical to the initial premise
`observation does always destroy a system'. It follows that there is
actually little need for that terminology. Indeed, \qm"=micro has no
internal structure and, hence, an often discussed issue about
boundary (and limit\footnote{A.~Zeilinger: ``\ldots\ no limit. The limit
is only a question of \ldots\ money and of experience''
\cite[$13'09''$]{zeilinger2}.}) between micro and macro
\cite{saunders, home, ballentine, auletta} is devoid of sense. This
may be a matter only of `different macros'---the `smaller/""bigger';
\ie, when they describe certain models.

As a (partially philosophical\look[sorry]) aside, we note that what
is understood by observational randomness does, in fact, boil down
to distinguishability, and more specifically, to postulating the
micro"=chaos \eqref{rule}. In considering the denial of \eqref{rule}
as an impossible proposition, we arrive at the
\hyperlink{M}{\red\textsf{M}}"=paradigm and conclude that the only way
to deal with that which is contemplated for the subject"=matter of a
physical description must be the treatment of micro-acts as
ensembles \cite[Lect.~6]{mises}. In other words, and in accordance
with the outline of the clicks' analysis set out below, the
determinism of micro"=processes (micro"=ontology)---much less the
microscopic time"=arrow---is meaningless as a concept, since they are
not processes but structureless acts that have not even any
relationship to each other. Since there are as yet no any physical
phenomena as such, the claim that `phenomenon\hbox{-1} appears to be
the cause that precedes phenomenon\hbox{-2} as the effect' is no
more than a collection of words. To attribute to them physical
content and mathematical formulation at the micro"=level is
impossible in principle; the `problem of boxes' noted above.
Accordingly, the cause of (classical) macro"=indeterminism is the
absurdity of the notion of its twin
concept---micro"=determinism---and the unavoidable repetition of the
arrows $\goto$ (\hyperlink{M}{\red\textsf{M}}). N.~Bohr: ``there can be
no question of causality in the ordinary sense of the word''
\cite[p.~351]{jammer}. See also~\cite[p.~223]{mises}.
\end{comment}

\subsection{Quantum ensembles and statistics}\label{A+S}

Let us call the upper row in \eqref{macro}, as a $\statePsi$"=copy
set, (quantum) homogeneous \emph{ensemble} (Kollektiv, by von~Mises
\cite{mises}). We will designate it, simplifying when needed, by any
way
\begin{equation*}
\{\underbrace{\statePsi\:\statePsi\cdots\statePsi}_\text{$N$
times}\}\equiv\{\statePsi\cdots\statePsi\}_N
\equiv\ansPsi_N\,,
\end{equation*}
where $N$ is understood to be an arbitrary large number. Scheme
\eqref{macro} dictates also to consider the generic ensembles
\begin{equation}\label{mix}
\big\{\{\state{\alpha}_1\cdots\state{\alpha}_1\}_{n_1^{}}\;
\{\state{\alpha}_2\cdots\state{\alpha}_2\}_{n_2^{}}\;\;
\cdots\cdots\big\}\,,\qquad
\{\cdots\statePsi\cdots\statePsi\:\statePhi\cdots\statePhi\:
\state\Theta\cdots\state\Theta\cdots\}
\end{equation}
as collections of homogeneous sub"=ensembles. Ensembles are
symbolized in the same manner as sets, but, for the convenience of
perception, without the numerous commas and internal parentheses
$\{\}$ in \eqref{mix}; for example,
\begin{equation*}
\big\{a\,b\cdots b\{b\,c\,a\}\cdots\big\}=
\{a,b,\ldots,b,b,c,a,\ldots\}=\quad\cdots\quad\FED
\{ab\cdots bbca\cdots\}\,.
\end{equation*}
%The finiteness and non-finiteness in ensembles are necessary by
%analogy with operations on series. Upon comparing the finite
%quantities, in reasoning, the operation $\sum n_s\to\infty$ is
%executed.

Scheme \eqref{macro} is the first point where numbers emerge in a
theory, and conversion
\begin{equation*}
\lceil\state\alpha\text{-ensemble
\eqref{mix}}\rceil\quad\rightarrowtail\quad(n_1\,,n_2\,,\ldots)
\end{equation*}
into the integer collection precedes a \emph{numerical
$\scr A$"=measurement of} $\cal S$. Quantities $n_s\in\bb Z^+$,
however, should not be associated with such, as they are potentially
infinite. The minimal way of creating the knowingly finite numbers
out of independent and potential infinities $n_s$ (without loss of
their independence) is to divide each of them by a greater infinity,
which is a `constant' $\Sigma$ for the entire ensemble \eqref{mix}.
It is clear that one should put
\begin{equation}\label{nu}
\Sigma\DEF n_1+n_2+\cdots\quad\text{and}\quad\nu_1\DEF\frac{n_1}{\Sigma}\,,\quad
\nu_2 \DEF\frac{n_2}{\Sigma}\,,\quad\ldots\quad(\Sigma\to\infty)\,,
\end{equation}
and that ensemble \eqref{mix} does not provide any numerical data
besides the relative frequencies \eqref{nu}. All the other data are
functions of $\nu_s$. An independence of the theory from\OK\ the
ensemble's $\Sigma$"=constant, \ie, the procedure $\Sigma\to\infty$,
is also implied to be a principle---the $\Sigma$"=postulate. Without
(idealization) $\Sigma$"=postulate of infinity, there can be no
question of a theory, \ie, empiricism will not turn into a
mathematics (\S\S\,\ref{inv}--\ref{semi}).

Thus the \hyperlink{M}{\red\textsf{M}}"=paradigm \eqref{macro} does not
only give birth to a concept of `numerical data in the theory'
per~se, but also converts their $\bb Z^+$"=discreteness into the
$\bbR$"=continuum of real measurements. Namely, numbers
$\nu_s\in\bbR$ are the statistics $(\nu_1,\nu_2,\ldots)$ of
destructions $\GOTO{\sss\scr A}$ into the ensemble of primitives
$\{\{\state{\alpha}_1\}_{n_1}$, $\{\state{\alpha}_2\}_{n_2}$, \ldots\}.

\subsection{Distinguishability and numbers}\label{2.6}

Distinguishability of the two ensembles now turns out to be the
$\bbR$"=numerical, \ie, it is determined by the difference between
$\nu$"=numbers. As a result, and according to
pt.~\hyperlink{R}{\red\textsf{R}}, the two elements
$\ketPsi\not\approx_{\!\!\!\sss\scr A}\ket{{}\tilde{\bo\Psi}}$ of
$\bbH$ will differ in the numbers $\frak a_s$ and
$\tilde{\frak a}_s$, if the latter turn out to be the bearers of
different statistics
\begin{equation}\label{stat}
\nu_j(\frak a_1,\frak a_2,\ldots)\ne\tilde\nu_j
(\tilde{\frak a}_1,\tilde{\frak a}_2,\ldots)\,.
\end{equation}
In consequence, distinguishability $\not\approx$ is carried over to
$\bbH$ with an extension to the non"=eigen objects, but it is
inherently incomplete, since it does not take into consideration the
most significant fact---arbitrariness of transitions \eqref{Box}.

Actually, the collection $(\nu_1,\ldots)$, as a final result of
transitions $\{\statePsi\goto\state\alpha_s\}$, `knows nothing'
about their left hand side, much less about its uniqueness
$\statePsi$. If, for instance, we would require
$\state{\texttt{?}}=\statePsi$ under equal $\state\alpha$"=statistics
$\{\nu_s\}$ for the two families
$\{\state{\texttt{?}}\goto\alpha_s\}_{\sss N}$ and
$\{\statePsi\goto\alpha_s\}_{\sss N}$ (collectivity of
$\state{\texttt{?}}$'s), that would mean a mass control over
transitions \eqref{rule}. Instead of a `black box' above, we find
that prior to acts $\GOTO{\sss\scr A}$ all the $\state{\texttt{?}}$'s
were equal to $\statePsi$. This, however, is the declaration of a
property: `prior to observation the system $\cal S$ was/""dwelled in
\ldots'. With any continuation of this sentence, it is pointless and
prohibited, if it is theoretically accepted that prior to
observation nothing exists and there are no properties
(sect.~\ref{S}). The indeterminacy of the ingoing
$\state{\texttt{?}}$'s is therefore mandatory, and numbers
$(\nu_1,\nu_2,\ldots)$ required for recognition are manifestly
insufficient. Considering that the micro"=changeability of single
primitives $\statePsi$ means nothing \cite{alter},
\cite[p.~493]{auletta}, \cite[p.~419(!), left column]{lipkin}, only
a generic ensemble
\begin{equation}\label{A}
\{\state{\texttt{?}}\cdots\state{\texttt{?}}\}\quad\rightarrowtail\quad
\{\cdots\statePsi\cdots\statePsi\:\statePhi\cdots\statePhi\:
\state\Theta\cdots\state\Theta\cdots\}\FED\frak A
\end{equation}
can be the intermediary in the sought"=for translation of
$\statePsi\in\boT$ onto representations $\ket\Xi\in\bbH$, when
constructing~\eqref{Repr}.

In the accustomed physics terminology, the above is expressed in the
sequence
\begin{Align}\label{quant}
\lceil\text{state}\rceil\;\GOTO[6]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A_\text{quant}}}\;&
\;\lceil\text{state$'\rceil$}\;&&\longmapsto\;
\lceil\text{measurement}\rceil\,.
\intertext{The removal of the intermediate component here, \ie,
switch to the sequence} \label{class}
\lceil\text{state}\rceil\;\GOTO[6]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A_\text{class}}}\;&
\;\;\cdots\cdots&&\longmapsto\;\lceil\text{measurement}\rceil\,,
\end{Align}
amounts to the rejection of micro"=destructibility and of
unpredictability. Even with the classical consideration, this
supposition is questionable, since the notion of `change when
observed' disappears. The relationships between the dual
concepts---(micro/macro)"=scopicity, big/middle/small, \etc---are
also lost. That is the reason why, strictly speaking,
\begin{itemize}
\item \label{ClassQuant}\emph{all observations}, regardless of
 (envisioned physical) macro/meso/micro characteristics, have the
 structure \eqref{quant}, \ie, are the quantum observations.
 \emph{No non"=quantal observations exist}.
\end{itemize}
With their idealized `roughening', the classical description appends
numeric $\nu$"=statistics to \eqref{class}, which is when the
left/right parts of \eqref{class} become indistinguishable with
respect to the arrow symbols. The arrows may then be replaced with
the equivalence
\begin{equation}\label{grubo}
\lceil\text{state}\rceil\quad
\mathop{\smallmatrix
\ds{\dashleftarrow}\mathchar"439\mathchar"439\mathchar"439\\[-0.5ex]
\ds\mathchar"439\mathchar"439\mathchar"439{\dashrightarrow}
\endsmallmatrix}\limits^{\raise-1ex%
\hbox{\smash[b]{$\Smaller[2]{\scr A_\text{class}}$}}}\quad
\lceil\text{$\nu$"=statistics numbers}\rceil\,.
\end{equation}
Supplementing the right hand side here with the concept of numeric
values $\{\alpha_s\}$ for all of the observables $\scr A=A(q,p)$ (or
for phase observables $\{q_1,q_2,\ldots;p_1,p_2,\ldots\}$), this side will
turn into an exhaustive numerical realization of the left hand side.
Criterion $\approx$, then, turn into the $\bbR$"=numeric equality $=$
of all the $\scr A$"=statistics or into an equality of phase
distributions $\varrho(q_1,\ldots;p_1,\ldots)$. This is a situation of the
classical (statistical) physics (ClassPhys), \ie, when `the physics
is initially identified' with quantities being numeric in character.
The ill"=posedness of such a paradigm---the core motive of quantum
theory---is discussed further below at greater length in
sects.~\ref{phys}, \ref{2slit}, and \ref{Numbers}. Consequently,
`classicality' is not and cannot be considered as a primitive in the
logical construct. In both these cases,
distinguishability~$\not\approx$ depends on the concept of
$\state\alpha$"=states.

\begin{comment}\label{rem4}
From this point onward, by state we will strictly mean
representations \eqref{Repr}. So it makes \emph{no sense to speak of
transitions between states} in this case, much less of ``transition
from possible to actual'' (Everett \cite[p.~189]{barrett})
\cite{schloss, joos, zurek}. The writing $\ket\Xi\goto\ket{\alpha}$
and its typical the wave function collapse interpretation are not
correct. In fact, in treating transition
$\ket\Xi\goto\ket{\alpha_1}$ as a state-to"=state destruction, its
left hand side cannot carry any information about
$\nu_{\!\!\sss(\scr A)}$"=frequencies for other events
$\ket\Xi\goto\ket{\alpha_s}$, \emph{much less} about amount of
destruction from envisioned $\scr B$"=observations
$\ket\Xi\GOTO{\sss\scr B}\ket{\beta}$. Such
$\nu_{\!\!\sss(\scr B)}$"=`amounts' are always present at standard
comprehension of the $\ket\Xi$"=symbol. For this reason, the concept
of a state should not be used as a correct term at all
\cite{ludwig5}; the terminology, however, has been settled.
\end{comment}

The motivation given above---\hyperlink{S}{\red\textsf{S}} (system,
primitives), \hyperlink{O}{\red\textsf{O}} (observation) and
\hyperlink{R}{\red\textsf{R}} (representations),
\hyperlink{T}{\red\textsf{T}} (taboo), the semantic principia
\hyperlink{I}{\red\textbf{\textsf{I}}} (\qm"=statics) and
\hyperlink{II}{\red\textbf{\textsf{II}}} (numbers) complemented below with
the principium~\hyperlink{III}{\red\textbf{\textsf{III}}}---is sufficient
for further creating the basis of mathematical formalism of \qm.
These tenets should hardly be considered as postulates, at least in
the common meaning of the phrase `postulates of a physical theory',
since they are of a naturally language nature, and are, as we
believe, the points of departure for reasonings whatever the
approach to the micro-world. As it was emphasized above, these
principles do not stipulate for pre"=determined mathematics and
physics, with the exception of an already well"=established
metamathematical and linguistic understanding \cite{kleene, raseva}
of how to approach\look[?comprehend, apprehend?] the mathematical
axioms, structures, theories, and their interpretations altogether.
See also Remarks~\ref{seven} and \ref{meta}, and
sects.~\ref{EmpMath}, \ref{interpret}.

\section{Ensemble formations}\label{Ans}

\ldots\ they come totally or not at all}\\
\textsc{W.~James}}
\smallskip

The key corollary of the macro"=paradigm \eqref{macro} is not merely
the appearance of numeric data in the theory, but also the fact that
the further construct must rely not on isolated primitives, but on
their aggregates being considered as an integrated whole, \ie, as a
set. This causes a choice for the ensemble notation.

\subsection{Mixtures of ensembles}\label{mixture}

Returning to the analysis of transitions
$\state{\texttt{?}}\goto\alpha_s$, one gets that the lower row in
\eqref{macro} comes actually from indeterminacy
\begin{equation*}
\array{c}
\{\state\alpha_1\}_{n_1^{}}\:\{\state\alpha_2\}_{n_2^{}}
\cdots\cdots\\[0.5ex]
\UP\quad\UP\quad\UP\quad\UP\quad\UP\\[0.5ex]
\cdots\state{\texttt{?}}\cdots\state{\texttt{?}}\cdots\state{\texttt{?}}
\cdots\cdots
\endarray
\end{equation*}
and thus \eqref{macro}, by virtue of \eqref{A}, should be replaced
with the scheme
\begin{equation}\label{Macro}
\array{c}
\{\cdots\statePsi\cdots\statePhi\cdots\state\Theta\cdots\}\\[0.5ex]
\scr A\;\;\DOWN\quad\DOWN\quad\DOWN\quad\DOWN\quad\DOWN\;\;\scr A\\[0.5ex]
\big\{\cdots\state\alpha_1\cdots\state\alpha_2\cdots
\big\}
\endarray\,,
\end{equation}
wherein the composition of the upper ingoing row may not be
predetermined. Fundamentally, according to \eqref{quant} it may not
be withdrawn from \eqref{Macro}, yet at the same time the meaning of
the row can in no way be aligned with the adjective `observable' via
typical empirical/""physical words: properties, readings,
quantities/""amounts, and other `observable' characteristics. Such a
non"=detectability is the equivalent of that a box may be prepended
to the scheme \eqref{Box}:
\begin{equation}\label{chain}
\def\fboxsep{1.5\dimen36}
\boxed{\cdots\cdots}\TRANS{}\statePsi\;
\smash{\ds\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}}\;\state\alpha\,.
\end{equation}

If $\state\beta$'s serve as $\statePsi$ in \eqref{chain}, then we
have the schemes of precedence and of continuation:
\begin{equation*}
\def\fboxsep{1.5\dimen36}
\boxed{\cdots\cdots}\;\smash{\ds\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}}\;
\state\alpha\;\smash{\ds\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr B}}}\;
\state\beta\qquad\text{or}\qquad \boxed{\cdots\cdots}\;
\smash{\ds\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr B}}}\;\state\beta\;
\smash{\ds\TRANS[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}}\;\state\alpha\,.
\end{equation*}
Let an observer capture the fact of any distinguishability in the
intermediate $\scr A$. Section~\ref{S} tells us that this may be
only the distinguishability of objects
$\{\state\alpha_1,\state\alpha_2,\ldots\}$; hence, this very $\scr A$
turns into an observation (pt.~\hyperlink{O}{\red\textsf{O}}). The
\hyperlink{M}{\red\textsf{M}}"=paradigm then gives rise to the numbers
of $\state\alpha$"=events $(n_1,n_2,\ldots)$ and, thereupon, their
relative frequencies $(\varrho_1,\varrho_2,\ldots)$ by the rule
\eqref{nu}. If subsequently micro"=observations $\scr B$ are to
follow, then a composite macro"=observation $\scr B\circ\scr A$ has
been formed, and frequencies $\{\varrho_j\}$ cannot but impact on
statistical characteristics of these later $\scr B$"=observation's
micro"=events. However, being an ingoing ensemble for $\scr B$, each
homogeneous $\{\state\alpha_s\cdots\state\alpha_s\}_{n_s}$ is
indistinguishable from an indefinite ensemble
$\{\cdots\statePsi\cdots\statePhi \cdots\}_{n_s}$, since the concept
of `$\approx_{\!\!\!\sss\scr A}$"=sameness' is unknown for $\scr B$.
Instrument $\scr B$ is `aware of only its own
$\approx_{\!\!\sss\scr B}$ and cannot know \emph{what} it
destroys'\footnote{Rejection of this point brings us once again
(p.~\pageref{bbox}) to attempts at `penetrating into the black box'
of transitions \eqref{box}, \ie, to attempts at creating the physics
of a more primary level.}, or that the source"=object consists of one
and the same $\state\alpha_s$. According to
pts.~\hyperlink{O}{\red\textsf{O}} and \hyperlink{M}{\red\textsf{M}}, an
instrument produces nothing more than its own `destruction list'; in
this case $(\{\state\beta_1\}_{m_1},\{\state\beta_2\}_{m_2},\ldots)$.
This list is completely independent of the other ones, since,
according to pt.~\hyperlink{R}{\red\textsf{R}}$(\bullet\bullet)$, there can not be
restrictions on $\boT_{\!\sss\scr A}$ and $\boT_{\!\sss\scr B}$. In
case the set $\{\state\alpha_s\cdots\state\alpha_s\}_{n_s}$ transits
into collection $\{\state\beta_k\cdots\state\beta_k\}_{n_s}$, this
means that $\state\alpha_s$ has always transited into one and the
same $\state\beta_k$ every time (under the convention
$\Sigma\to\infty$), and there takes\OK\ place merely a coincidence
$\state\alpha_s=\state\beta_k$ of eigen"=primitives in the lists
$\boT_{\!\sss\scr A}$ and $\boT_{\!\sss\scr B}$.

If $\scr B\circ\scr A$ is proceeded with a third observation
$\scr C$, the preceding analysis is repeated recursively with the
same result; only the values $\{\varrho_j\}$ will be changed. In
consequence, only the following two ingoing types for macro"=scheme
\eqref{Macro} are conceivable:
\begin{Align}
\big\{\cdots\statePsi\cdots\statePhi\cdots\state\Theta\cdots\big\}\quad&
\begin{array}{l}
\text{indefinite ensemble}\\\lceil\text{no statistics}\rceil,
\end{array}\label{m1}\\
\big\{\{\cdots\statePsi\cdots\statePhi\cdots\}
^{{\sss(}\varrho_1^{}\sss)}\,
\{\cdots\statePsi\cdots\statePhi\cdots\}^{{\sss(}\varrho_2^{}\sss)}
\cdots\big\} \quad&
\begin{array}{l}
\text{ensemble mixture}\\\lceil\text{with statistics
$(\varrho_1,\varrho_2,\ldots)$}\rceil.
\end{array}\label{m2}
\end{Align}
It is reasonable to regard case \eqref{m2} as a mixture of the
system $\scr A$"=preparations
\begin{equation*}
\{\cal S^{{\sss(}\varrho_1^{}\sss)},\,
\cal S^{{\sss(}\varrho_2^{}\sss)},\, \ldots\}\quad\hhence\quad
\{\state\alpha_1^{{\sss(}\varrho_1^{}\sss)},\,
\state\alpha_2^{{\sss(}\varrho_2^{}\sss)},\, \ldots\}\,,
\end{equation*}
to each of which we assign the positive number $\varrho_s<1$,
referred to as its statistical weight. These weights---``an element
of reality'' \cite[p.~649]{peres0}---are all that is inherited from
the preparation $\scr A$, and subsequent micro"=observation acts
$\scr B$ are performed on indefinite ensembles \eqref{m1} again. It
is clear that in the view of transitions $\smash{\GOTO{}}$ in scheme
\eqref{Macro}, this situation is a derivative of \eqref{m1}, and
this very type \eqref{m1} is crucial \cite[p.~53]{ballentine2}. In
other words, if preparation is considered a concept as essential as
observation (pt.~\hyperlink{O}{\red\textsf{O}}), we still remain within
the framework of the primary essence of a transition:
\begin{equation*}
\statePsi\GOTO[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr B}}\state\beta\,,\qquad
\state\alpha\GOTO[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr B}}\state\beta\,.
\end{equation*}
Its left hand side should always be seen as an undetermined
primitive, even though we treat/call it preparatory
(micro)observation. See also ``preparation"=measurement reciprocity''
in \cite{ballentine4}.

\subsection{Ensemble brace}\label{brace}

According to pts.~\hyperlink{R}{\red\textsf{R}} and
\hyperlink{M}{\red\textsf{M}}, representations \eqref{Repr} must
reflect all information about physics of the problem:
primitives/""incomes, transitions (`arrows' $\goto$), and outgoing
statistics. All that data are contained in scheme \eqref{Macro},
which is why the maximum that the model of a future mathematical
object, which characterizes everything we get while watching the
$\cal S$, can rely on is the \emph{ensemble brace}:
\begin{equation}\label{obj}
\obj{\state\Xi}\DEF\mbig[13]\lgroup\![9]
\array{c}
\{\cdots\statePsi\cdots\statePhi\cdots\state\Theta\cdots\}\\[0.5ex]
{\scs\scr A}\:\DOWN\quad\DOWN\quad\DOWN\quad\DOWN\quad\DOWN\:{\scs\scr A}\\[0.5ex]
\big\{\cdots\state\alpha_1\cdots\state\alpha_2\cdots\big\}
\endarray\![9]
\mbig[13]\rgroup
\end{equation}
(or a couple of ensemble bunches). It is immediately seen that
\eqref{obj} carries the radical difference between situation
\eqref{quant} and its `roughening' \eqref{grubo}; because of the
upper row. The enormous arbitrariness within the brace and arrows
$\GOTO{\sss\scr A}$ is `programmed' to give birth to the different
processing rules of statistics and to effects being typical for \qm.
Thanks to maximality of \eqref{obj}, it has been just this row which
encodes all the sought-for cases of
distinguishability~$\not\approx$. In particular, by varying the
upper row, while the lower one remains unchanged, we get into a
situation, when $\state\alpha$"=statistics $(\nu_1,\nu_2,\ldots)$ is
found to be the same for $\obj{\state\Xi}$ and
$\obj{\state{\tilde\Xi}}$, meanwhile,
$\obj{\state\Xi}\not\approx\obj{\state{\tilde\Xi}}$.

The further problem is thus as follows. With the indefinite
$\frak A$"=ensemble \eqref{A} in hand, \ie, with the upper row of
\eqref{obj}, is it possible, based on the principles described
above, to bring the still incomplete relation $\not\approx$ to the
maximal quantum"=physical distinguishability of states?

The first priority, in the $\not\approx$"=distinguishability of
objects \eqref{obj}, is to separate the closest and unconditional
criterion---the outgoing $\state\alpha$"=statistics. To do this, let
us split the lower row into families
$\big\{\{\state\alpha_1\}_{\infty_1^{}}
\{\state\alpha_2\}_{\infty_2^{}}\cdots\big\}$, where
\begin{equation}\label{infty}
\infty_1+\infty_2+\cdots=\infty\,,
\end{equation}
and, subsequently (rather than the reverse, otherwise \eqref{m2}),
taking into account the `arbitrariness of arrows', we also split the
upper row:
\begin{equation}\label{split}
\obj{\state\Xi}=\mbig[13]\lgroup\![11]
\begin{array}{r@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}l}
\big\{&\{\cdots\statePsi\cdots\statePhi\cdots\}
_{\hbox to0ex{$\scs\infty_1^{}$}}&\qquad
\{\cdots\statePsi\cdots\statePhi\cdots\}
_{\hbox to0ex{$\scs\infty_2^{}$}}\qquad
&\cdots&\big\}\\
&\DOWN\quad\DOWN\quad\DOWN\quad\DOWN&\DOWN\quad\DOWN\quad\DOWN\quad\DOWN&\\
\big\{&\{\state\alpha_1\cdots\cdots\state\alpha_1\}
_{\hbox to0ex{$\scs\infty_1^{}$}}&
\{\state\alpha_2\cdots\cdots\state\alpha_2\}
_{\hbox to0ex{$\scs\infty_2^{}$}}&\cdots&\big\}
\end{array}\![8]
\mbig[13]\rgroup
\end{equation}
(the indication of observation $\GOTO{\sss\scr A}$ is omitted
further below, since it has been reflected in primitives
$\state\alpha$). Hereafter, infinities $\infty_j$ stand for cardinal
numbers (a number of elements, possibly finite) of their own
ensembles. Therefore extension of distinguishability \eqref{stat}
should be produced from comparison of the sub"=objects like
\begin{equation}\label{tmp0}
\begin{array}{c}
\{\cdots\statePsi\cdots\statePhi\cdots\}
_{\hbox to0ex{$\scs\infty_1^{}$}}\\
\DOWN\quad\DOWN\quad\DOWN\quad\DOWN\\
\{\state\alpha_1\cdots\cdots\state\alpha_1\}
_{\hbox to0ex{$\scs\infty_1^{}$}}
\end{array}\quad
\end{equation}
that differ from each other in the upper row composition.

\subsection{Continuum of quantum phases}

Cardinality of the $\boT$"=set cannot be finite. This would entail
finitely many $\state\alpha$"=primitives for all kinds of
instruments. But finiteness of this number $\cal N$ would mean an
exclusivity of its value that does not follows from anywhere. At the
same time, all the $\frak A$"=ensembles \eqref{A} are subsets of the
set $\boT$ (boolean\label{bulean} $2^\boT$); any finite portion of it is
ruled out. Hence, the infinite variety of upper rows in \eqref{tmp0}
is uncountable.

Aside from numeric $\nu$"=statistics, the
program~\hyperlink{R}{\red\textsf{R}} does also require an association
of the numeric objects with each row
\begin{equation*}
\frak A=\{\cdots\statePsi\cdots\statePsi\:\statePhi\cdots\statePhi\:
\state\Theta\cdots\state\Theta\cdots\}
_{\scs\infty}\quad\hhence\quad\cdots\,,
\end{equation*}
because primitive's symbols must disappear in the ultimate
description. In order to avoid introducing the structures ad~hoc, we
will produce numbers here in the same manner, in which statistics
were producing in sect.~\ref{A+S}. Indeed, the logical genesis of
the concept of a number must be single in theory. That is, we should
again take into account the presence of copies of primitives, and
write
\begin{equation}\label{tmp}
\cdots\quad\hhence\quad
\big\{\{\statePsi'\}_{\infty'}\{\statePsi''\}_{\infty''}\:
\cdots\big\}\,,
\end{equation}
and numbers per~se will come into being by the $\Sigma$"=convention
like \eqref{nu}. Thus, on the one side, the discreteness of
micro"=transition acts is embodied in \eqref{tmp} with the sequence
$(\statePsi',\statePsi'',\ldots)$, and on the other, the uncountability
of micro"=arbitrariness is inherited by attaching the symbolic
`quantities'---`countless' characters $(\infty'$, $\infty''$,
\ldots)---to elements of this sequence. The global discreteness says
that there are no grounds to assume a more than countable infinity
$\aleph_0$ for the set $\boT$, \ie, $|\boT|=\aleph_0$. The infinity
of the family \eqref{tmp}, hence, has the type
\begin{equation*}
2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph\,,
\end{equation*}
\ie, it is continual \cite{kurat}. Which possibilities exist for the
form of row~\eqref{tmp}?

The trivial case $\frak A=\big\{{\{\statePsi'\}_{\infty'}}\big\}$
for \eqref{tmp} drops out at once, since element $\statePsi'$ would
always go into the one and the same primitive:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{c}
\{\statePsi'\cdots\cdots
\statePsi'\}_{\hbox to0ex{$\scs\infty_1^{}$}}\\
\DOWN\quad\DOWN\quad\DOWN\quad\DOWN\\
\{\state\alpha_1\cdots\cdots\state\alpha_1\}
_{\hbox to0ex{$\scs\infty_1^{}$}}
\end{array}\quad=\quad
\begin{array}{c}
\{\statePsi'\}_{\infty_1}\\\!\!{\scs\scr A}
\DOWN{\!\cdot{\cdot}\cdot\!}\DOWN{\scs\scr A}\quad\\
\{\state\alpha_1\}_{\scs\infty_1^{}}
\end{array}\,.
\end{equation*}
But this is tantamount to the identity
$\statePsi'\equiv\state\alpha_1$, which robs of any meaning the
concept of transition $\GOTO{\sss\scr A}$ whatsoever. Hence, for
each of the formations \eqref{tmp}, the following options are
admissible:
\begin{multline}\label{N3}
\big\{\underbrace{\{\statePsi'\}_{\infty'}
\{\statePsi''\}_{\infty''}}_{N=2}\big\}\,,\quad\ldots,\quad
\big\{\underbrace{\{\statePsi'\}_{\infty'}
\{\statePsi''\}_{\infty''}\,\{\statePsi'''\}_{\infty'''}\: \cdots}_{3\leqslant
N<\infty}\big\}\,,\quad\ldots\quad \\
\ldots,\quad\big\{\underbrace{\{\statePsi'\}_{\infty'}
\{\statePsi''\}_{\infty''}\,\{\statePsi'''\}_{\infty'''}\:
\cdots}_{N=\infty}\big\}
\end{multline}
with minimal $N=2$. If some of the infinities
$(\infty',\infty'',\ldots)$ are finite here (or even countable), this
does not change the total continuality $\aleph$. The extreme case
$N=\infty$---a countable infinity of continuums---changes also no
this count because of $\aleph+\aleph+\cdots=\aleph$ \cite{haus}. All
of these infinities may be even countably duplicated, without
augmenting the continuum, since
$\aleph\cdot\aleph\cdots=\aleph^{\aleph_0}=\aleph$.

We will think of all the brace \eqref{tmp0} as indistinguishable in
their patterns, \ie, only one of the schemes \eqref{N3} is realized.
This fixes the structural staticity of theory, because, otherwise,
it is unclear why one (unrecognizable upper) row should differ from
another in the number (what?) of defining primitives
$\{\statePsi',\statePsi'',\ldots\}$ (which ones?). By analogy with
\eqref{nu}, the only way to implement the said above is the
introducing the cardinals as
\begin{equation}\label{infty'}
\varkappa'\DEF\frac{\infty'}{\infty}\,,\qquad
\varkappa''\DEF\frac{\infty''}{\infty}\,,\qquad
\varkappa'''\DEF\frac{\infty'''}{\infty}\,,\qquad\ldots\,.
\end{equation}

\begin{comment}
A few remarks may be made in connection with case $N=\infty$. It is
related to a conglomerate of infinities, which has the form of
discretely infinite family of continual infinities $\{\varkappa'$,
$\varkappa''$, \ldots\}, and things would have been even `worse' had the
staticity of one of the schemes \eqref{N3} been changed to
variability. Such formations would need to be equipped with topology
and with associated concepts of convergence and of limit. But all
this touches on principally unobservable numeric entities, for which
it is not clear how to motivate the further reductions to a `finite
mathematics' as required: dimensions, finite approximations, finite
numbers (which ones?), \etc. Moreover, all of that would pertain
only to the global structural parameters of the theory prior to
constructing it per~se, not to mention the physical models. To put
it plainly, such an assumption would result not to a theory but to a
theory of theories and so on ad infinitum which should be somewhere
terminated in any way. For these reasons, we leave the case
$N=\infty$ aside, though it might be worth elaborating it. However,
in sect.~\ref{naturalC}, we will give a further justification of
that the numeric domain of the theory is just what it has already
been known in~\qm.
\end{comment}

By examining non"=minimal options $N=3$, $N=4$, \ldots, we conclude that
they should be dismissed, since there immediately arises an issue
associated with the questionable empirical exclusivity of a certain
`world integer $N$', which characterizes the number of `physically
inaccessible' $\statePsi$"=objects. That is, these options would be
topologically related to a certain nontrivial dimension $N\geqslant3$ with
unmotivated origin.

For the remaining case $N=2$ one establishes that, in the following
writing
\begin{equation*}
\{\statePsi'\cdots\statePsi'\}_{\infty_1'}\cup
\{\statePsi''\cdots\statePsi''\}_{\infty_1''}\quad
\smallmatrix
\dashrightarrow\\[-0.5ex]\dashrightarrow\\[-0.5ex]\dashrightarrow
\endsmallmatrix\quad\{\state\alpha_1\cdots\state\alpha_1\}_{\infty_1^{}}
\end{equation*}
of the scheme \eqref{tmp0}, none of the primitives $\statePsi'$,
$\statePsi''$ may coincide with $\state\alpha_1$. Otherwise, the
unrestricted adjunction of identical transitions
$\state\alpha_1\goto\state\alpha_1$ to \eqref{tmp0} would mean
indeterminacy of both the number $\varkappa_1$ and the actual
statistics $(\nu_1,\nu_2,\ldots)$.

Not counting the `extremely complex' case $N=\infty$, the only
option $N=2$ remains. It should have been adopted even before, on
the ground that the most minimalistic construction, which
set"=theoretically gives rise, as a minimum, to the minimal numerical
object---a single number---corresponds to the minimal $N=2$ in
\eqref{N3}. The maximal case is problematic, while mid-ones are
ruled out. Consequently, all possible assumptions regarding the
upper row structure in \eqref{tmp0} are indistinguishable from a
case just as if the row contained two primitives only. Functionality
of the symbol $\cup$, having regard to inclusion of copies
$\statePsi'$ and $\statePsi''$, is unchanged as is; see further
sect.~\ref{inv} below.

We now take into account that each of the numbers \eqref{infty'} is
mathematically generated by the standard scheme: $\lceil$(or\-der\-ed)
in\-te\-gers$\rceil$ $\rightarrowtail$ $\lceil$(or\-der\-ed)
ra\-tio\-nals$\rceil$ $\rightarrowtail$ $\lceil$(or\-der\-ed)
con\-ti\-nu\-um$\rceil$. The natural ordering $<$ is always present
here and, as is well known \cite[p.~52]{stoll}, can be
isomorphically represented by the set"=theoretic inclusion~$\subset$
on a certain system of sets. This inclusion, in turn, is directly
concerned with the semantics of sect.~\ref{S0}. The natural"=language
term `accumulating'---`the old is being nested into the new'---is
formalized into the creating of sets from ensembles (see
sect.~\ref{inv}).

We now conclude that all kinds of schemes \eqref{tmp0} form an
$\aleph$"=continuum, for which there is no reasonable rationale for
equipping it with a topology other than the standard order topology
of the 1"=dimensional real $\bbR$"=axis or its equivalents. Call the
quantity $\varkappa\in\bbR$ \emph{quantum phase}.

It should be added, that in considering some two upper rows in
\eqref{tmp0} as infinite sets
\begin{equation*}
\{\statePsi\cdots\statePsi\}_{\infty'}\cup
\{\statePhi\cdots\statePhi\}_{\infty''}\quad\text{and}\quad
\{\statePsi\cdots\statePsi\}_{\tilde\infty'}\cup
\{\statePhi\cdots\statePhi\}_{\tilde\infty''}\,,
\end{equation*}
one can always establish their formal identity. However, physics
requires to distinguish the rows, which is what the numeric part of
pt.~\hyperlink{R}{\red\textsf{R}} and comparison of cardinals
$(\infty'$, $\infty'')$ `serve'.

\subsection{Statistics $+$ phases}\label{StatPh}

Thus the closest reconciliation of scheme \eqref{split} with the
\hyperlink{R}{\red\textsf{R}}($\bullet$)"=postulate is an ensemble brace of
the form
\begin{equation}\label{split'}
\obj{\state\Xi}=\mbig[13]\lgroup\![11]
%
\begin{array}{c}
\big\{\{\statePsi\}_{\infty_1'}
\{\statePhi\}_{\infty_1''}\big\}\\\DOWN\quad\DOWN\quad\DOWN\quad\DOWN\\
\{\state\alpha_1\cdots\cdots\state\alpha_1\}
_{\hbox to0ex{$\scs\infty_1^{}$}}
\end{array}
\quad
\begin{array}{c}
\big\{\{\statePsi\}_{\infty_2'}
\{\statePhi\}_{\infty_2''}\big\}\\\DOWN\quad\DOWN\quad\DOWN\quad\DOWN\\
\{\state\alpha_2\cdots\cdots\state\alpha_2\}
_{\hbox to0ex{$\scs\infty_2^{}$}}
\end{array}\quad
\begin{array}{c}\cdots\cdots\\\\\cdots\cdots\end{array}\![8]
\mbig[13]\rgroup
\end{equation}
followed\OK\ by the (upper) continual numeration through
$\bbR$"=numbers
\begin{equation}\label{phase}
\varkappa_s\DEF\frac{\infty_s'}{\infty_s}\qquad
(\infty_s\DEF\infty'_s+\infty''_s)\,.
\end{equation}
In other words, quantitative description in the theory is created on
a basis of the minimal building bricks
\begin{equation}\label{min}
\mbig[13]\lgroup\![11]
\begin{array}{c}
\big\{\{\statePsi\}_{\infty'}\{\statePhi\}_{\infty''}\big\}\\
\DOWN\;\;\;\DOWN\;\;\;\DOWN\;\;\;\DOWN\\
\{\state\alpha\cdots\cdots\state\alpha\}_{\hbox to0ex{$\scs\infty$}}
\end{array}\![8]
\mbig[13]\rgroup\qquad(\textit{unitary brace})
\end{equation}
with \emph{two} abstract ingoing primitives.

Now, we have cardinals connected by relation \eqref{infty} and the
structure \eqref{split'}--\eqref{phase}. In the above"=described
context, parentheses $\{\;\}$ and symbols
$\statePsi,\,\statePhi,\,\goto$ no longer carry meaning at this point.
Therefore, we may omit them as `extraneous' and write \eqref{split'}
as
\begin{equation*}
\obj{\state\Xi}\quad\hhence\quad\bigg\lgroup\![8]
\array{c}\varkappa_1\\\infty_1\endarray\bigg|
\array{c}\varkappa_2\\\infty_2\endarray\bigg|
\array{c}\cdots\\\cdots\endarray\![8]\bigg\rgroup=\cdots,
\end{equation*}
where $\state\alpha_s$ are well represented by a subscripted
numeration; observation $\scr A$ has been fixed\OK\ so far. Let us
now introduce a statistics from the `embracing infinity'
\eqref{infty}:
\begin{equation*}
\cdots=\bigg\lgroup\![8]
\array{c}\varkappa_1\\\nu_1\cdot\infty\endarray\bigg|
\array{c}\varkappa_2\\\nu_2\cdot\infty\endarray\bigg|
\array{c}\cdots\\\cdots\endarray\![8]\bigg\rgroup= \bigg\lgroup\![8]
\array{c}\varkappa_1\\\nu_1\endarray\bigg|
\array{c}\varkappa_2\\\nu_2\endarray\bigg|
\array{c}\cdots\\\cdots\endarray\![8]\bigg\rgroup\![8]
\array{c}\\\!\!\!{}\cdot\infty\endarray\,,\qquad
\nu_s\DEF\frac{\infty_s}{\infty}\,.
\end{equation*}
Then, by $\Sigma$"=postulate, one arrives at a continually numerical
labeling\label{labeling} of objects~\eqref{split'}:
\begin{equation*}
\obj{\state\Xi}\quad\hhence\quad\mbig[5]\{\mbig(
\smallmatrix \ds\varkappa_1\\\ds\nu_1\endsmallmatrix
\mbig),\;\mbig(
\smallmatrix \ds\varkappa_2\\\ds\nu_2\endsmallmatrix
\mbig),\;\ldots\mbig[5]\}\,.
\end{equation*}
Recall that the arithmetical operations on the emergent pairs
$(\nu,\varkappa)$ are still out of the question, and $\Sigma$"=limit
does not care the `innards' of $\obj{\state\Xi}$. Only one of all
the potentially infinite quantities tends to infinity: the total
cardinality \eqref{infty} of brace \eqref{split'}. What is remained
`non"=extraneous' in \eqref{split'} is $\state\alpha$'s, and we
return them to their place. Hence, from the viewpoint of observation
$\scr A$, the aggregate of all the possible brace \eqref{obj} is
indistinguishable from an order"=indifferent 2"=parametric family of
data
\begin{equation}\label{set}
\obj\Xi=\mbig[5]\{\mbig(
\smallmatrix \ds\varkappa_1\\\ds\nu_1\endsmallmatrix
\mbig)\state\alpha_1,\;\mbig(
\smallmatrix \ds\varkappa_2\\\ds\nu_2\endsmallmatrix
\mbig)\state\alpha_2,\;\ldots\mbig[5]\}\,.
\end{equation}
We drop a lower bar in the symbolic designation $\obj{\state\Xi}$,
highlighting the fact that the meaning of the $\obj\Xi$"=object
becomes increasingly divorced from primitives in
pt.~\hyperlink{S}{\red\textsf{S}} and gets into the numeric domain to
match the programme~\hyperlink{R}{\red\textsf{R}}.

As an outcome, despite the freedom of ingoing collection in
\eqref{split} and quantum micro"=arbitrariness, the
distinguishability
$\obj{\state\Xi}\not\approx\obj{\state{\tilde\Xi}}$ is \emph{indeed
determinable}, it is determinable not only by statistics and is the
$(\bbR\Times\bbR)$"=numerical:
\begin{equation}\label{not}
\obj{\Xi}\not\approx\obj{\tilde\Xi}\,,\quad\text{if}\quad
(\nu_s,\,\varkappa_s)\ne(\tilde\nu_s,\,\tilde\varkappa_s)\,.
\end{equation}
What is more, the preliminary (classical) $\not\approx$"=criterium
\eqref{stat} fits in \eqref{set}--\eqref{not} as a particular case
by omitting the $\varkappa$"=numbers and middle link from
\eqref{quant}. That is to say, the ignoring of quantum
`$\varkappa$"=effects' is only possible via the
$(3\mapsto2)$"=reduction \eqref{quant} into \eqref{class}, with an
automatic imposition of the ClassPhys description. A simplified and
hypothetical version of \qm\ over $\bbR^1$ is also ruled out. It
would mean a reduction of the two numbers $(\nu,\varkappa)$ to a
single one. But they have fundamentally different origin. The
construct and reasoning in sect.~\ref{S} tell also us that the
attempt at a greater `quantum specification' to \eqref{box} and
\eqref{quant} is impossible by virtue of the 2-row
structure---ingoing/""outgoing---of the object $\obj{\state\Xi}$, and
distinguishability by numeric pairs \eqref{not} is highest possible.

The $\obj\Xi$"=objects \eqref{set} remain and they, as a family,
exhaustively inherit the problem's physics. The quantities $\nu_s$
are the really observable (unitless) numbers---the percentage
quantity of events, which an instrument/""observer declares to be
distinguishable $\state\alpha$"=objects. The quantities $\varkappa_s$
are the internal and unremovable degrees of freedom. Figuratively
speaking, the $\varkappa$'s may be speculatively referred to as
phases, but they may not be associated with an actual quantity of
something. Not only is any `material' treatment of these `amounts'
impossible, but it is fundamentally \emph{prohibited}, since the
converse would have meant endowing the nonexistent boxes
\eqref{box}--\eqref{Box} with a notional content or asserting the
nature of their origin. Justification is only allowed here for the
fact of their existence, which is reflected by presence of the left
hand side in the concept of transition
$\statePsi\GOTO{\sss\scr A}\state\alpha$ (Remark~\ref{two}).

In view of numerous and ongoing discussions of the meaning\label{smysl}
of the quantum state \cite{nielsen}, note that any its (even merely
similar) classical/""ontological and causal `visualization mechanisms'
\cite[p.~137]{silverman} as wave function of a `certain real
matter', of a hypothetical observable, of the `objective knowledge',
or of the `classical data' (whatever this all means) are---and this
we stress with emphasis---pointless for the same reason. See also
sect.~\ref{SM}. This is why
\begin{itemize}
\item it is impossible \cite[p.~13]{englert} to make/""prepare,
 observe/""read-off/""approximate, transmit or measure a state, or endow
 it with the property of being known/""unknown, or physically
 recognize/""distinguish it from the other.
\end{itemize}
This thesis has no undergone a change even with regard to the word
`statistics' in the Born rule \cite{brezhnev}, if only because the
rule is a substantial---two-to-one---reduction of the
$(\varkappa,\nu)$"=data. The state will itself, when created as a
mathematical object, determine the meaning\label{povtor} of the mentioned
words (see sect.~\ref{izmer}) with an appropriate concept of the
physical distinguishability (sect.~\ref{MM}). Cf.~ the works
\cite{lundeen, pusey} and the ``methods to directly measure general
quantum states \ldots\ by weak measurements'' in \cite{lundeen2}.

All the $\varkappa_s$ and $\nu_s$ are independent of each other,
except for relation $\nu_1+\nu_2+\cdots=1$. Taking into account the
admissible renormalization of both $\bbR$"=numbers, the pair
$(\nu,\varkappa)$ can be topologically identified with a point on
the complex plane:
\begin{equation*}
\mbig(\smallmatrix \ds\varkappa_{}\\[0.3ex]
\ds\nu\endsmallmatrix\mbig)\;\rightleftarrows\;
(\lambda,\mu)\in\bbR^2\FED\bbC\,.
\end{equation*}

The issue of the numerical domain over which the quantum description
is being done---the real $\bbR$, complex $\bbC$, the quaternions
$\msf Q$ or whatever---is non"=trivial and continues to be the
subject of study \cite{aaronson, baez, ludwig3}. The complexity
$\bbC$ is often motivated by a quantum dynamics (Schr\"odinger's
equation) \cite[p.~132, Stueckelberg]{jauch1}, \cite{stueck},
however, such a motivation is inconsistent, and as we have seen,
there is no need for it. The rigidity of the $\bbC$"=domain points to
the fact that, in particular, the quaternion \qm\ also has no place
to originate from \cite[sect.~10.1]{auletta}, although it was the
object of theoretical constructs in the 1960--70's \cite{jauch2}.
Note that even the most comprehensive works \cite[p.~217]{ludwig3},
\cite[p.~131]{jauch1}, \cite[p.~234]{beltrametti}, \cite{benioff},
and \cite{baez}(!) observe a difficulty in the full substantiation
of the $\bbC$"=domain.

The above"=outlined reading the emergence of numeric quantities in
theory is draft at the moment, and will be refined further below in
sect.~\ref{Numbers}.

Up to this point we have dealt, roughly speaking, with a single
abstract aggregate $\obj{\state\Xi}$ isolated from the others.
However, the constructional nature of the ensemble brace
\eqref{split'} entails the following closedness relation between
them. Every brace $\obj{\state\Xi}$ is composed of some others in
infinitely many ways (for remote analogies, see
\cite[sect.~11.2]{allah}), \ie, it is a union
\begin{equation}\label{union}
\obj{\state\Xi}=\obj{\state\Xi'}\cup\obj{\state\Xi''}\,,
\end{equation}
and, to put it in reverse, any union of two brace is a third
object"=brace. In collections \eqref{union}, the operation $\cup$,
which generates them, is commutative and associative:
\begin{equation}\label{ComAss}
A\cup B = B\cup A\,,\qquad (A\cup B)\cup C=A\cup(B\cup C)\,,
\end{equation}
and these 2- and 3-term relations not only are not a formal
supplement, but should be read as the \emph{structural} properties
in general.

\subsection{Union of ensembles}\label{inv}

 Consider the lower $\state\alpha$"=rows of brace
\eqref{split} and experimental forming the new real
$\state\alpha$"=ensembles from them. Let the procedure of
such\look[?that] forming be denoted by $\msf U(A,B,\ldots)$, where $(A,
B,\ldots)$ are the ensembles per~se. Its essence is such that it is
comprehensively determined by the following minimum: a rule that
involves the \emph{minimal} (\ie, two) number of arguments
$\msf U(A, B)=\texttt{?}$ and a rule of the \emph{repeated} applying
$\msf U$ to itself: $\msf U(\msf U(\ldots),\ldots)=\texttt{?}$. Obviously, we
should write
\begin{equation}\label{U}
\msf U(A, B)=\msf U(B, A)\,,\qquad
\msf U\big(\msf U(A,B),C\big)=\msf U\big(A,\msf U(B,C)\big)\,,
\end{equation}
which is of course merely the empirical rephrasing the standard
properties \eqref{ComAss} of operation $\cup$. However, the converse
is logically preferable: empiricism \eqref{U} is formalized into the
abstract properties \eqref{ComAss}. If we now attach the upper
`quantum' primitives to the low $\state\alpha$"=rows---a requirement
of sect.~\ref{S}---then the operationality of actions with the
resulting $\obj{\state\Xi}$"=braces would be just like that of
$\msf U$, \ie, \eqref{U}. In other words, we carry over properties
\eqref{U} (and use them everywhere) to the general operation on
$\obj{\state\Xi}$"=brace, without distinguishing between the essences
of symbols $\cup$ and $\msf U$. `Micro"=operationality' of empiricism
and its formalization are confined, at most, by the rules
\eqref{ComAss}--\eqref{U}.

Let us temporarily discontinue using the numerical terminology as
applied to $\obj\Xi$"=objects. They differ from each other due to
relationships between their `innards', rather than because of our
assignment of differed symbols $(\lambda,\mu)$ to them. The brace
are comprised of elements that are combined into sets and are added
to them. In the language of an abstract logic, we are dealing with
the fact that transitions $x$ form the brace $A,\,B$, \ldots, \ie, they
are in the membership relationships $x\in A$, $x\in B$, \ldots\ or,
when accumulated as micro-acts, `get belonged to them'. That is to
say, the brace themselves and their formation (accumulation of
statistics for the $\Sigma$"=limit) are equivalent to a huge number
of propositional `micro"=sentences $x\in A$ \texttt{or} $x\in B$
\texttt{or} \ldots'. However, again, this is nothing but a logically
formal equivalent of the union operation~$\cup$:
\begin{equation}\label{cup}
A\cup B=\big\{x\,\big|\:(x\in A)\Vee(x\in B)\big\}\,,
\end{equation}
which is already being constantly exploited above.

\begin{comment}
As is well known \cite{stoll, kurat}, due to properties of logical
atoms $\in$ (\texttt{member\-ship}) and $\Vee$ (\texttt{or}), the
properties of sentences like \eqref{cup} are determined precisely by
rules \eqref{ComAss} for $\cup$. Technically, we should also take an
idempotence $A\cup A=A$ into account, however. At the same time, the
need to have a number requires that the duplicates in ensembles have
to be taken into consideration. Nevertheless, this situation is
easily simulated by the set theory itself. Indeed, consider first
the lower row in \eqref{obj} as a strictly abstract set
$\{\state\alpha',\state\alpha'',\ldots\}\subset\boT$. Then, instrument
$\scr A$ `asserts' the distinguishable elements $\{\state\alpha_1$,
$\state\alpha_2,\ldots\}$ and those that should be thought of as their
equivalents:
\begin{equation*}
\state\alpha_1'\approx\state\alpha_1''\approx\cdots
\FED\state\alpha_1\,, \qquad
\state\alpha_2'\approx\state\alpha_2''\approx\cdots
\FED\state\alpha_2\,, \qquad\ldots\,.
\end{equation*}
This equivalence can be characterized, say, by words `a detector
click at one and the same place $\state\alpha_1$'. Upon such a
formalization, one obtains the formation
$\{\state\alpha_1'\,\state\alpha_1''\cdots\}\,
\{\state\alpha_2'\,\state\alpha_2''\cdots\}$ $\cdots$ $\approx$
$\{\state\alpha_1\cdots\}\, \{\state\alpha_2\cdots\}$ $\cdots$, \ie,
the very lower row in \eqref{split}. It is within this context that
we think of the union operation without falling into contradiction.
Accordingly, $\obj{\state\Xi}\cup \obj{\state\Xi}\ne\obj{\state\Xi}$
but the standard symbol $\cup$ continues to be used for simplicity.
\end{comment}

Therefore if we get back to the numerical labels \eqref{set}, but
ignore the `inner composition` of $\obj{\state\Xi}$, \ie, the
\hyperlink{M}{\red\textsf{M}}"=paradigm, thus excluding $\cup$ and
\eqref{ComAss} from the reasoning, then all kinds of
$\obj{\Xi}$"=objects would turn into the semantically `segregated
ideograms'. Micro"=transitions, their mass nature, arbitrariness,
$\not\approx$"=distinguishability, and the `quantumness' of the task
at all simply disappear. To take an illustration, the obvious
statement
\begin{gather*}
\text{the brace $\{\statePsi\GOTO{\sss\scr A}\state\alpha\}\FED
\obj{\state\Xi}$ has an empirical `kindred'}\\[-1ex]
\text{with its duplication
$\{\statePsi\GOTO{\sss\scr A}\state\alpha,\,\statePsi
\GOTO{\sss\scr A}\state\alpha\}\FED \obj{\state\Xi'}$}
\end{gather*}
becomes pointless, because the property $\obj{\state\Xi}\cup
\obj{\state\Xi}=\obj{\state\Xi'}$ is missing. This is despite the
fact that the creation of the transition copies in
$\obj{\state\Xi'}$ is a primary operation for generating the objects
and reasoning at all. Construction of the theory would then become
possible only with the interpretative introduction of the vanished
concepts anew. Therefore macro"=empiricism necessitates that the
relationships \eqref{ComAss} be operative rules, and with that the
quantumness or classicality of consideration is of no significance.

\begin{comment}\label{seven}
Let us look at the situation on the opposite---mathematical---side.
The union of sets $\cup$ is a fundamental operation already at the
level of the set"=theoretic formalization; \eg, the Zermelo--Fraenkel
(\zf) axioms \cite{kurat}. This is one of the first ways on how to
create sets---the axiom of union. So if we believe in the
set"=theoretic mode of explaining/""creating the quantum rudiments, the
quantitative description will inevitably invoke operationality of
the mathematical primitive $\cup$ through rules \eqref{ComAss}. This
would be suffice to declare,

\begin{itemize}
\item inasmuch as \emph{we have nothing but $\cup$ and
 $\obj{\state\Xi}$} \textup{(taboo~\hyperlink{T}{\red\textsf{T}})},
 commutativity/""associativity of theory is then postulated at the
 outset, with the subsequent carrying these structures over to
 numeric representations, \ie, to $\bbR$ or $\bbC$.
\end{itemize}
It is preferable, however, to adhere to the sequence order in
ideology more stringently---$\lceil$ob\-ser\-va\-tion $\rightarrowtail$
ma\-the\-ma\-tics$\rceil$, $\lceil$em\-pi\-ri\-cism $\rightarrowtail$
numeric re\-pre\-sent\-at\-ion$\rceil$, without substitution it for the
opposite. At least, if we rely upon the following comprehension of
the empiricism: our elementary perceptions are formalized only into
sets and set"=theoretic $\cup$"=abstraction \eqref{cup}. See also
\cite[Ch.~3]{ludwig5}, \cite[p.~178]{fuchs4}, \cite[p.~323]{jammer},
\cite{bueno}, \cite[pp.~12, 86, Ch.~4]{chomsky}, sect.~\ref{phil},
and \cite{benioff}.
\end{comment}

Summing up, we detect a kind of a junction point: the physical and
mathematical fundamentality of operation $\cup$ for describing the
elementary acts. That is to say, the mathematics of
$\obj{\state\Xi}$"=brace \eqref{split'} and of objects \eqref{set}
may not inherently be exhausted by them as `bare' sets without
structures. Recalling now pr.~\hyperlink{II}{\red\textbf{\textsf{II}}}, we
draw a conclusion regarding the very construction of the theory.
\begin{itemize}
\item Reconciliation of the \hyperlink{R}{\red\textsf{R}}"=paradigm with
 empiricism must transform itself into \emph{rewriting} the primary
 ensemble $\cup$"=constructions \eqref{split}, \eqref{split'},
 \eqref{min}, and relationships between them into the language of
 numeric symbols.
\end{itemize}
More formally, we have the following continuation of
pt.~\hyperlink{R}{\red\textsf{R}}$(\bullet)$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[\hypertarget{R+}{{\red$\msf R^\textsf{+}$}}]
 \emph{Homomorphism\label{R+} of the ensemble brace properties `onto
 numbers'}: mutual $\cup$"=relationships \eqref{ComAss} between the
 $\obj{\state\Xi}$"=brace should be carried over to relations between
 their numeric $\obj\Xi$"=representations \eqref{set}.
\end{itemize}
Thereby, we once again fix the maximum that is available for the
construction of quantum mathematics. One may handle only the
$\cup$"=aggregates of transitions---constructions $\eqref{split'}$,
\eqref{set}---and the minimal modules~\eqref{min}.

\subsection{Semigroup}\label{semi}

In line with \eqref{union}, let us split the unitary brace
\eqref{min} into two ones or combine two brace into one. Remove also
the symbols of primitives $\statePsi$ and $\statePhi$ from there. As
was pointed out above, they are not necessary at this stage.
Replacing the notation of upper cardinals \eqref{min} with pairs
$(\infty'_{\sss1},\infty'_{\sss2})$ and
$(\infty''_{\sss1},\infty''_{\sss2})$, upon the union one obtains
\begin{equation}\label{comp}
(\infty'_{\sss1},\infty'_{\sss2}) \cup
(\infty''_{\sss1},\infty''_{\sss2})=(\infty'_{\sss1}+\infty''_{\sss1},
\infty'_{\sss2}+\infty''_{\sss2})\,.
\end{equation}
Here, addition~$+$ obviously satisfies the properties
\eqref{ComAss}. If the cardinal `$\infty$"=coordinates' are replaced
with the `finite percentages' $(\varkappa,\frak S)$ introduced
above, \ie, if one puts
\begin{equation}\label{birat}
\Big\{\varkappa=\frac{\infty_{\sss1}}
{\infty_{\sss1}+\infty_{\sss2}}\,,\quad
\frak S=\infty_{\sss1}+\infty_{\sss2}\Big\}\,,\qquad
\Big\{\infty_{\sss1}=\varkappa\,\frak S\,,\quad
\infty_{\sss2}=(1-\varkappa)\,\frak S \Big\}
\end{equation}
as in \eqref{phase}, then rule \eqref{comp} acquires the form of a
number composition:
\begin{equation}\label{s}
(\varkappa',\frak S')\bo\circ (\varkappa'',\frak S'')=
\bigg(\frac{\ds\varkappa'\frak S'+\varkappa''\frak S''}{\ds\frak S'+
\frak S''}\,,\;\frak S'+\frak S''\bigg)\,.
\end{equation}
The commutativity/""associativity properties of operation $\bo\circ$
hold here due to birationality of \eqref{birat}. Then, the formal
application of $\Sigma$"=postulate, \ie,
$\frak S'+\frak S''\to\infty$, breaks, however, the symmetry
$(')\leftrightarrow('')$ and associativity of $\bo\circ$, since
\begin{equation}\label{s'}
(\varkappa',\frak S')\bo\circ (\varkappa'',\frak S'')\quad\rightarrowtail\quad
\varkappa'\bo\circ\varkappa''=s\cdot\varkappa'+(1-s)\cdot\varkappa''\,,
\qquad s\DEF\frac{\ds\frak S'}{\ds\frak S'+\frak S''}\,,
\end{equation}
where $s$ is an undefined parameter. Consequence of the same kind
holds also true for the $\nu$"=components of pairs \eqref{set}, for
which a convex $w$"=combination of statistics does arise:
\begin{equation}\label{NU}
(\nu'_1,\nu'_2,\ldots)\bo\circ(\nu''_1,\nu''_2,\ldots)\FED(\bo\nu'
\bo\circ\bo\nu'')=w\cdot\bo\nu'+(1-w)\cdot\bo\nu''\,,\qquad
w\DEF\frac{\ds\Sigma'}{\ds\Sigma'+\Sigma''}\,.
\end{equation}

At the same time, the splitting \eqref{comp} is no more than an
`intrinsic reshuffle' of one and the same $\obj{\state\Xi}$"=brace
that `knows nothing' about concept of a number (numbers $s$, $w$),
much less about the concept of observation or its numeric form.
Therefore mathematics of the ensemble structures should be
independent of any representation for \eqref{union} by such
operations as \eqref{s}. Composition
$\obj{\Xi'}\bo\Circ\obj{\Xi''}=\obj\Xi$ should be determined solely
by its constituents $(\nu',\varkappa')$ and $(\nu'',\varkappa'')$.

\begin{comment}
In classical statistics, the foregoing has an analog as
insensitivity of data on events to the way of their
gathering\look[?thereof] and of layout; for example,
$(2,3)+(1,4)\equiv(0,6)+(3,1)\equiv\cdots\FED \texttt{data}$. Then, the
observation proper is being created by the scheme
$\texttt{data}\rightarrowtail(3,7)\mapsto
\big(\frac{3}{3+7},\frac{7}{3+7}\big)=(0.3,0.7)=(\nu_1,\nu_2)\FED
\texttt{observ}$. Parameters like $w$ can appear in $\obj\Xi$ only if,
prior to any of the $\cup$"=unions \eqref{union}, a construction like
\eqref{m2} has been fixed. That is, the invariantly number-free
brace \eqref{union} \emph{has been supplemented by an external
number} $w$ and ratio $w:(1-w)$. The correction
$\obj\Xi\rightarrowtail\big\{\obj{\Xi'}^{{\sss(}w\sss)},
\obj{\Xi''}^{{\sss(}1-w\sss)}\big\}$ of the theory, related to this
number and to arrays \eqref{m2}, is very well known. This is a
$w$"=statistical mixture $\{(w;\psi'), (1-w;\psi'')\}$ of wave
functions, accompanied\OK\ by a formalization in terms of the
statistical operator $w\cdot\ket{{}\psi'}\bra{{}\psi'}+(1-w)\cdot
\ket{{}\psi''}\bra{{}\psi''}$.
\end{comment}

Now, in order that numeric $(\nu,\varkappa)$"=realization \eqref{set}
of ensemble brace \eqref{split'} inherits quantum empiricism
(\hyperlink{O}{\red\textsf{O}}, \hyperlink{M}{\red\textsf{M}}) and
structural properties \eqref{union}--\eqref{ComAss} correctly, we
reassign the quantities $(\nu,\varkappa)$ with a `percentage
meaning' and replace them with different numbers~$[\lambda,\mu]$:
\begin{equation}\label{set'}
\obj\Xi=\mbig\{\big[\smallmatrix \mu_1\\
\lambda_1\endsmallmatrix\big]\,\state\alpha_1\,,\;
\big[\smallmatrix\mu_2\\
\lambda_2\endsmallmatrix\big]\,\state\alpha_2,\;\ldots\mbig\}
\end{equation}
(this important passage will be touched upon once again in
sect.~\ref{Dupl}). In so doing, each pair
$\big[\smallmatrix\mu'\\[-0.35ex]\lambda'\endsmallmatrix\big]$,
$\big[\smallmatrix\mu''\\[-0.35ex]\lambda''\endsmallmatrix\big]$
behaves as a whole, and, under coinciding $\state\alpha_s$, the
pairs
are endowed with a composition $\big[\smallmatrix\mu'\\[-0.35ex]
\lambda'\endsmallmatrix
\big]\oplus\big[\smallmatrix\mu''\\[-0.3ex]\lambda''\endsmallmatrix
\big]$ that is to be commutative. Along with this, if symbol
$\uplus$ denotes a composition of objects \eqref{set'} then it
should obviously copy properties~\eqref{ComAss}:
\begin{equation*}
\obj\Xi\uplus\obj{\Psi}=\obj{\Psi}\uplus\obj\Xi\,,\qquad
\big(\obj\Xi\uplus\obj{\Psi}\big)\uplus\obj{\Phi}=
\obj\Xi\uplus\big(\obj{\Psi}\uplus\obj{\Phi}\big)\,.
\end{equation*}

The finite ensembles are vanishingly small in their contribution
into infinite ones ($\Sigma$"=postulate), \ie, elements of the
$\obj{\state\Xi}$"=family, as infinite sets, are considered modulo
finite ensembles\footnote{The `finitely many' is forbidden in
theory. As soon as we put the numbers of $\state\alpha_1$, of
$\state\alpha_2$, \ldots\ to be finite, we get immediately the numeric
distinguishability $n_1\ne n_2$, \ldots; \ie, the act of
macro"=observation.}. Let us designate their image as $\obj{0}$, and,
due to property $\obj\Xi\uplus\obj0=\obj\Xi$, it is naturally
referred to as zero. The collection \eqref{set'} itself has also
been formed by the $\cup$"=combining the ingredients
\begin{equation*}
\mbig\{\big[\smallmatrix \mu_1\\
\lambda_1\endsmallmatrix\big]\,\state\alpha_1\,,\;
\big[\smallmatrix\mu_2\\
\lambda_2\endsmallmatrix\big]\,\state\alpha_2\,,\;\ldots \mbig\}\equiv
\mbig\{\big[\smallmatrix \mu_1\\
\lambda_1\endsmallmatrix\big]\,\state\alpha_1\mbig\}\cup
\mbig\{\big[\smallmatrix\mu_2\\\lambda_2\endsmallmatrix\big]\,
\state\alpha_2\mbig\}\cup\cdots=\cdots\,,
\end{equation*}
and which is why the same symbol $\uplus$ may be freely used between
objects with different~$\state\alpha_s$:
\begin{equation*}
\cdots=\mbig\{\big[\smallmatrix \mu_1\\
\lambda_1\endsmallmatrix\big]\,\state\alpha_1\mbig\}\uplus
\mbig\{\big[\smallmatrix\mu_2\\\lambda_2\endsmallmatrix\big]\,
\state\alpha_2\mbig\}\uplus\cdots\,.
\end{equation*}
For the sake of brevity, we omit the redundant curly brackets
further, redefining
\begin{equation}\label{set''}
\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}\DEF\big[\smallmatrix \mu_1\\
\lambda_1\endsmallmatrix\big]\,\state\alpha_1\uplus
\big[\smallmatrix\mu_2\\
\lambda_2\endsmallmatrix\big]\,\state\alpha_2\uplus\cdots\,.
\end{equation}

As a result, we have had that the set"=theoretic prototypes
\eqref{split}--\eqref{tmp0}, \eqref{split'} of states \eqref{Repr}
do invariantly exist in form of all kinds of $\cup$"=decompositions.
Thus, in dealing with the only instrument $\scr A$, one reveals the
following property.
\begin{itemize}
\item For each observation $\scr A$, the set of
 $\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}$"=objects forms an infinite commutative
 semigroup $\frak G$ with respect to operation~$\uplus$.

 An internal (beyond the observation) nature of
 $\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}$"=objects \eqref{set''} is characterized by
 commutative superpositions
 $\obj{\Xi'}_{\!\sss\scr A}\uplus\obj{\Xi''}_{\!\sss\scr A}$ thereof,
 which are independent of the classical composition of observational
 $\nu$"=statistics.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Measurement}\label{izmer}

The described above numerical $\obj\Xi$"=version of the
$\obj{\state\Xi}$"=brace `$\cup$"=phenomenology' makes it possible now
to preliminarily formalize the concept, the absence of which
deprives the theory of its logical foundation. Namely,
\emph{measuring statistics by observation $\scr A$ over~$\cal S$}:
\begin{equation}\label{red}
\text{\qm-measurement}:\qquad\big([\lambda_1,\mu_1],
[\lambda_2,\mu_2],\ldots\big)\mapsto
(\nu_1,\nu_2,\ldots)\,.
\end{equation}
That is, the $[\lambda,\mu]$"=collection gets mathematically mapped
into the $\nu$"=statistics. This is a maximum of information provided
by observation $\scr A$. The mapping \eqref{red} annihilates the
pairs $[\lambda,\mu]$. Therefore the inheritance/""homomorphism of
operations $\cup$ and $\uplus$ onto anything at all is eliminated.
Upon operation \eqref{red}, both the $(\varkappa,\nu)$"=sets and
$\cup$"=unions thereof, $\uplus$"=operations, and the semigroup
$\frak G$ per~se disappear. As a result, the distinctive feature
subsequently referred to as superposition will also disappear. The
new numbers $\{\nu_s\}$ may be `added up' only as required by the
different, \ie, classical, rule: forming the convex combinations
\eqref{NU}. We note that the formalization of measurement does not
now depend on how the mathematical map
$[\lambda,\mu]\rightarrowtail(\nu)$ would be further
implemented---it is a separate job \cite{brezhnev}---or how the
$t$"=dynamics would be introduced.

\begin{comment}
Incorporation of $t$"=dynamics into the theory is still impossible
due to the absence of mathematics to be applied to instants $t_1$,
$t_2$. Accordingly, no physical $t$"=process may correspond to the
mathematical mapping \eqref{red}, while the known `conceptual'
problems with the collapse' dynamics \cite{gottfried, weinberg,
Hooft, london, mittel} are, in fact, non"=existent \cite{lipkin,
ludwig1, ludwig3}. More precisely, they stem from the blurring of
meaning which we typically give to the words `states' (what is
that?), `ensembles' (what are they comprised of?), and
`dynamics/""collapse' (of what?). In regard to the latter, the
authors\?[In regard to the latter, the assessment given by the
authors of \ldots\ is quite unambiguous] of the book \cite{ludwig5}
speak out in the most definitive manner---``fairy tales''.
\end{comment}

In sect.~\ref{S}, the fundamental premise of the
$\state\alpha$"=symbol"=based distinguishability~$\not\approx$ was the
foundation of the entire subsequent language. One then observes that
measurement or its outcome will essentially remain a vacuous
term---``For microsystems nothing can be directly measured''
\cite[p.~304]{ludwig2}---up until it invokes the concept of a
quantum state, \ie, the $\obj\Xi$- and $\state\alpha$"=objects. Once
again it is stressed that the concept of the state must precede the
notion of measurement, rather than the reverse.

\subsection{Invariance with respect to observations}\label{SS}

Up to this point we had had no need for the matching of observation
$\scr A$ with observation $\scr B$, although it is clear that a
description based on a certain specified $\scr A$ will inevitably be
non"=invariant with respect to the tool $\{\scr A,
\scr B,\ldots\}$---`observation space'---and unacceptable
(pt.~\hyperlink{R}{\red\textsf{R}}) due to the impermissible
exclusivity of the set $\{\state\alpha_1,\ldots\}$. At the same time,
we do not have anything but $\{\scr A, \scr B,\ldots\}$ and micro-acts
\eqref{macro} (pts.~\hyperlink{T}{\red\textsf{T}} and
\hyperlink{M}{\red\textsf{M}}). In the brace, this fact has already
been reflected: transitions $\GOTO{\sss\scr A}$ are combined into
integrities \eqref{obj}. Logically, however, the
$\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}$-, $\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr B}$"=objects are
incomparable and isolated from each other, as carriers of statistics
of different origin. On the other hand, `\emph{the same} is observed
by instrument $\scr B$, as by instrument $\scr A$'. Although this
context has not yet been invoked, without it the application of
set"=theoretic constructs to physics is devoid of
meaning\footnote{``The statements of quantum mechanics are meaningful
and can be logically combined \emph{only} if one can imagine a
\emph{unique experimental context}'' \cite[p.~115]{allah}.}, just
like the union of the speeds of an electron and of the Moon into a
set $\{\bo v_e,\bo v_{\sss \text{M}}\}$, with the subsequent
creating a certain `physical characteristic of this two"=body
system'; say, the mean velocity $\frac12(\bo v_e+\bo v_{\sss
\text{M}})$.

Thus the global structuredness is required in the set of various
$\obj\Xi$"=data according to the context `the same, identical' or its
negation. Apparently, this addition implies such entities as `the
same particle', `in the same preparation/state', `under the same
temperature, $\mbf M$"=environment \eqref{macro}', `the same closed
system $\cal S$', `in the same external field', `in the same
interferometer' with `the same detectors/""solenoids', \etc\
\cite{allah, auletta, greenberg}; short and generalized notation
$\SM$. All the concepts here, including the state, are physical
conventions, yet their formalization and modeling are required for
the creation of a theory (sect.~\ref{MM}).

The notion `with the same initial data' falls under the same
category, if the intention is to use the term time $t$. Again, the
very creating the $\obj\Xi$"=brace as a set `by the piece' is from
the outset thought of as (sect.~\ref{MM}) a creation on the
assumption of common $\SM$. For instance, the $\scr A$"=statistics
$\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}$ is gathered with `the same' $\SM$ as the
$\scr B$"=statistics $\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr B}$. On its part, any
variation is sufficient to obtain `not the same', even if we
`envision it as null' in the spirit of the widely known ``without in
any way disturbing a system'' \cite[p.~234]{schilpp}. To take an
illustration, equipment of interferometer (sect.~\ref{2slit}) with
additional `which-slit'\label{which} detectors is already at variance
with the notion of `the same $\cal S$'. In similar cases, we end up
in situations of type~\eqref{m2}, since the detectors cause an
$\state\alpha$"=distinguishability. Notice that the notions ``the
same'' and ``distinguishable'' (Remark~\ref{two}), while antonymous,
mutually exclude each other. Semantically, one without the other
makes no sense, which closely resembles Bohr's conception of
complementarity \cite{jammer}.

It follows from the above that in order to match $\scr A$ and
$\scr B$, the supra"=mathematical categories $\SM$ are required,
however, we are only in possession of the ensemble brace
$\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}$ and $\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr B}$
(pt.~\hyperlink{T}{\red\textsf{T}}). On the other hand, without joint
consideration of \emph{the two instruments}, \ie, without
introducing a mechanism of the mathematical matching
$\obj{\Xi'}_{\!\sss\scr A}\rightleftarrows\obj{\Xi'}_{\!\sss\scr B}$,
$\obj{\Xi''}_{\!\sss\scr A}\rightleftarrows\obj{\Xi''}_{\!\sss\scr B}$,
\ldots, the segregation of the $\obj\Xi$"=objects is absolute. (It is
clear that the matching of single micro"=events
$\statePsi\GOTO{\sss\scr A}\state\alpha_s$ and
$\statePsi\GOTO{\sss\scr B}\state\beta_j$ is also futile.) It is
impossible to associate physics with the abstractly segregated
$\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}$"=brace. Otherwise, the solitary object
$\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}$, generating nothing more than a statistics
provided by the single instrument $\scr A$, would yield a
description of everything, which is absurd by
pt.~\hyperlink{R}{\red\textsf{R}}$(\bullet\bullet)$. The physical contents (to
come) arise precisely through the above"=mentioned matching; see
sect.~\ref{phys} further below. As a result, we adopt a kind of the
relativity principle analogue: a tenet on the quantum observational
invariance.
\begin{itemize}
\item[\hypertarget{III}{\red\textbf{\textsf{III}}}] Theory\label{III} should
 introduce a means of equating the macro"=observations
 (pts.~\hyperlink{O}{\red\textsf{O}} $+$ \hyperlink{M}{\red\textsf{M}}) by
 differing instruments $\{\state\alpha_1,\ldots\}_{\!\sss\scr A}\ne
 \{\state\beta_1,\ldots\}_{\!\sss\scr B}$ under a common (`the same')
 experimental environment $\SM$. (\hbox{\embf{the $\bo3$-rd
 principium of quantum theory}})
\end{itemize}
Cf.~\cite[p.~632]{zeilinger1} and mathematical analogies
\cite{baez+, mazur}.

\subsubsection{Semantic closedness and the equal sign $=$}%
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{\qquad\qquad Semantic closedness and the
equal sign $=$}

We are currently returning once again to sect.~\ref{S}, falling into
a situation when the case in hand does not just entail fundamental
theory in the form of $\lceil$math$\rceil$~$+$ $\lceil$phy\-si\-cal
`bla-bla-bla'$\rceil$, while, continuing on an informal note, the
mathematics of physics---quantum mathematics---is being created
`from scratch'. When constructing this math, it is impossible to
forego physical conventions $\SM$, meanwhile, any preliminary and
the formal characterization for $\SM$ is ruled out. In fact, the
attempts to mathematically formalize the physical context of
observation, rather than observation itself, will not logically
manage without another---`more fundamental'---observation, in this
case, of the experimental environment. The semantic cycling is
apparent here, and any its mathematization will lead to a
retrogression of definitions into infinity (``von~Neumann
catastrophe'' \cite[pp.~158--\ldots]{dewitt}). Which is why, once again,
the `box \eqref{Box} method' prohibitions are required. See also a
paragraph containing the capitalized emphasize ``\textsc{cannot in
principle}'' on p.~418 of the work \cite{lipkin}. Sooner or later, it
will have to be declared that mathematics will be created for
\emph{the} conventions $\SM$, and that this mathematics will be a
mathematical model for this $\SM$. The analogous
argument---``mathematics is there to serve physics, and not the other
way round'' (L.~Hardy \cite[p.~242]{schloss3})---has already long
been met in the literature \cite{allah, auletta, fuchs3}. In
connection with the ``general contextual models'', see the book
\cite{hren9} (the V\"axj\"o"=model, ``quantum contextuality'') and
bibliography therein.

\begin{comment}\label{meta}
In order to avoid the just mentioned semantic/""linguistic
closedness---a kind of mathematical `pathology' of the physical and
natural languages---a description that lays claim to the role of an
unambiguous/""rigorous theory requires a careful separation of the
object- and meta"=languages. For more detail, see
\cite[\S\S\,14--16]{kleene}, \cite[sect.~V.1]{raseva},
\cite[sect.~3.9]{stoll}. For this reason, the constructs should
track the blending of the object \qm"=domain (syntax) and the
meta"=domain (semantics) and, more generally, the penetration of
extra"=linguistic elements of thinking \cite{chomsky} into \qm. The
notion of `the same $\SM$', which is intuitive in a natural
language, should explicitly be indicated as the external and
fundamental category (pr.~\hyperlink{III}{\red\textbf{\textsf{III}}}), and
its circular re"=interpretations/""re"=translations within the theory
should be banned. That is, re"=stating the `sameness $\SM$, identical
$\SM$' through a word or the equality sign~$=$ between some other
entities is forbidden. `The same' may no have a definition in terms
of anything. It exists prior to theory and has only a meaning
(\,$=$~cont\-ext). The physics terminology per~se
(sects.~\ref{phys},~\ref{2slit}, and \ref{divis}) will become
accessible when physical concepts are introduced via the
originating---and obligatorily very ascetic---quantum"=mechanics
language. See also a selected thesis in sect.~\ref{phil} on
p.~\pageref{forbiden}.

It is crucial to immediately note that, in the same manner, the
classical description contains the cited arguments in their
entirety. It is easy to convince that such a description also
implies implicitly that which is designated above as $\SM$; for the
physical reasoning would otherwise be entirely
impossible\footnote{Foulis--Randall: ``\ldots\ we often prefer to regard
a number of outcomes of distinct physical operations as registering
the same property, \ldots representing the same measurement. \ldots
permitting an unrestricted identification of outcomes would lead to
\texttt{"}grammatical chaos\texttt{"}'' \cite[p.~232]{foulis}.}.

\begin{comment}
Here, the situation is similar to the role of the axiom of choice in
the \zf"=system \cite{cohen, kurat}. It has been well known for a
long time that the axiom is often subconsciously implied
\cite[Chs.~II, IV]{frenkel}; it can also not be either circumvented
or ignored. Another counterexample to `infinite retrogression and
circularity' in logic comes from the very same system. This is a ban
on infinite chain of set memberships $\in$ on the left
\begin{equation*}
\bo\|\cdots\in X_n\in\cdots\in X_2\in X_1\in X_0
\end{equation*}
(the regularity axiom $[\forall x\in X,\: x\cap
X\ne\varnothing]\Rightarrow [X= \varnothing]$) under permissibility
of the infinite $(\in)$"=continuing to the right:
\begin{equation*}
X_0\in X_1\in X_2\in\cdots\in X_n\in\cdots\in\cdots
\end{equation*}
(not rigorously, the infinity axiom) \cite{shenfield, kurat}.

The obvious parallels here are the famous Russell paradox
\cite{frenkel} or a chaos in the computer file system when the `hard
links' from a folder to the parent folder are allowed. Thus the
relations $\in$ `downwards' to the left and necessarily terminates
in something, \ie, in a set which contains nothing:
$\varnothing=X_0\in\cdots \in X_n\in\cdots$. Therefore one needs to
give `meaning' to the only set---the empty one $\varnothing$.
Incidentally, it is these axioms that guarantee the existence of
infinitely many ordinal numbers \eqref{ordinal} and uniqueness of
this structure. The ordinals, and numbers at all, have yet to be
dealt with further below in more detail.
\end{comment}

All that remains is to add that no theory in physics is feasible
without re"=calculations of physical units, of vectors/""tensors,
without transformations in the fibre superstructures over manifolds,
\etc. Accordingly, the considerations on invariance and on
transformations should be present in the quantum case as well, but
it---which is its principal difference from the classical
case---still lacks the concepts of physical quantities/""properties
(see sect.~\ref{phys}). Therefore such argumentation may only be
applied to those objects that we have at our disposal, \ie, to the
$\obj\Xi$"=brace. In fact, the renunciation of
pr.~\hyperlink{III}{\red\textbf{\textsf{III}}} would be tantamount to the
inability to make the physics theories whatsoever.

Now, pr.~\hyperlink{III}{\red\textbf{\textsf{III}}} and the `quantum
diversity of the reference frames' $\scr A$ and $\scr B$ require a
kind of factorization of the entire family $\{\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A},
\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr B},\ldots,
\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}',\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr B}',\ldots\}$ with respect to
the conception $\SM$, \ie, the introduction of an operation of
equating the results $\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}$,
$\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr B}$ that came when observing $\cal S$. The
immediate putting $\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}=
\hspace{-0.65em}?\hspace{0.65em}\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr B}$ should not be
made, since these brace are simply different sets. That is why, with
isolated semigroups
\begin{equation*}
\big\{\underbrace{%
\overset{\raisebox{-0.21ex}{$\,\sss\smash[b]{\scr A}$}}{\uplus}\;;\;
\obj{\Xi'}_{\!\sss\scr A}\,,\obj{\Xi''}_{\!\sss\scr A}\,,\,\ldots}_
{\frak G_{\![3]\sss\scr A}}\big\}\,,\quad
\big\{\underbrace{
\overset{\raisebox{-0.21ex}{$\sss\smash[b]{\scr B}$}}{\uplus}\;;\;
\obj{\Xi'}_{\!\sss\scr B}\,,\obj{\Xi''}_{\!\sss\scr B}\,,\,\ldots}_
{\frak G_{\![3]\sss\scr B}}\big\}\,,\quad\ldots
\end{equation*}
at our disposal, we have to conceive of them as elements of a new
set \itsf{H} of objects of a single nature and 1) to carry out the
mapping $\{\frak G_{\![3]\sss\scr A}\,,
\frak G_{\![3]\sss\scr B}\,,\,\ldots\}\mapsto\itsf{H}$, assigning new
representatives $\ket{\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}}\in\itsf{H}$ to the
$\obj\Xi$"=brace, and 2) to equip \itsf{H} with an equivalence
relation $\ket{\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}}\approx\ket{\Xi_{\!\sss\scr B}}$
(the concept `the same' above). Let us implement all of that by the
scheme
\begin{equation}\label{o+}
\begin{array}{r@{}l@{}c@{}r@{}l@{}r@{}ccc}
\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}&{}\DEF\big[\smallmatrix \mu_1\\
\lambda_1\endsmallmatrix\big]\,\state\alpha_1
\overset{\raisebox{-0.21ex}{$\,\sss\smash[b]{\scr A}$}}{\uplus}
\big[\smallmatrix\mu_2\\
\lambda_2\endsmallmatrix\big]\,\state\alpha_2
\overset{\raisebox{-0.21ex}{$\,\sss\smash[b]{\scr A}$}}{\uplus}
\cdots&\quad\rightarrowtail\quad
&\big[\smallmatrix \mu_1\\
\lambda_1\endsmallmatrix\big]\,\bet{\alpha_1}\+
\big[\smallmatrix\mu_2\\
\lambda_2\endsmallmatrix\big]\,\bet{\alpha_2}\+\cdots{}
\FED{}&\ket{\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}}&{}\in\itsf{H}\,,\\[2ex]
%
\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr B}&{}\DEF\big[\smallmatrix \mu_1\\
\lambda_1\endsmallmatrix\big]\,\state\beta_1
\overset{\raisebox{-0.21ex}{$\sss\smash[b]{\scr B}$}}{\uplus}
\big[\smallmatrix\mu_2\\
\lambda_2\endsmallmatrix\big]\,\state\beta_2
\overset{\raisebox{-0.21ex}{$\sss\smash[b]{\scr B}$}}{\uplus}
\cdots&\quad\rightarrowtail\quad
&\big[\smallmatrix \mu_1\\
\lambda_1\endsmallmatrix\big]\,\bet{\beta_1}\+
\big[\smallmatrix\mu_2\\
\lambda_2\endsmallmatrix\big]\,\bet{\beta_2}\+\cdots{}
\FED{}&\ket{\Xi_{\!\sss\scr B}}&{}\in\itsf{H}\,,\\[1ex]
&\mathrel{}\ldots\ldots\ldots&\ldots\ldots&\ldots\ldots\ldots\mathrel{}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
In this, the new addition $\+$ must of course homomorphically
inherit operations
$\overset{\raisebox{-0.21ex}{$\,\,\sss\smash[b]{\scr A}$}}{\uplus}$,
$\overset{\raisebox{-0.21ex}{$\sss\smash[b]{\scr B}$}}{\uplus}$,
\ldots, and extension of this definition throughout \itsf{H} is then
made with the aid of the very equivalence~$\approx$:
\begin{equation*}
\ket{\Xi'_{\!\sss\scr A}}\+\ket{\Xi''_{\!\sss\scr B}}=
\Big| \ket{\Xi''_{\!\sss\scr B}}\approx\ket{\Xi''_{\!\sss\scr A}}
\hence\Big|=
\ket{\Xi'_{\!\sss\scr A}}\+\ket{\Xi''_{\!\sss\scr A}}=
\ket{\Xi'_{\!\sss\scr B}}\+\ket{\Xi''_{\!\sss\scr B}}\,.
\end{equation*}
Negation $\not\approx$ of the relation $\approx$, \eg,
$\ket{\Xi'_{\!\sss\scr A}}\not\approx\ket{\Xi''_{\!\sss\scr A}}$, is
exactly the very same distinguishability that was discussed in
sects.~\ref{S0}--\ref{Ans}.

For the sake of convenience, we adopt the regular sign $=$ for
$\approx$, in order not to introduce yet a further homomorphism,
which are already numerous, with more to come\look[more underway
(Яна)]. In other words, the physics $\SM$ is `concentrated' in the
sign $=$, turning the empirical structures \eqref{o+} into the
$\scr A$-, $\scr B$"=implementations of the object
$\ket\Xi\equiv\ket{\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}}= \ket{\Xi_{\!\sss\scr B}}$ that
is being constructed. The adequate term for
it---\texttt{DataSource}\label{datainfo}---corresponds to the preliminary
prototype of the concept of a state, but we will adhere to the
standard term, disregarding its variance.

\subsection{Representations of states}%\label{reprDev}

Let us simplify notation according to the rule
$\big[\smallmatrix\mu\\\lambda\endsmallmatrix\big]\FED\frak a$. The
sought-for relationships between $\scr A$, $\scr B$, \ldots\ then turn
into the equalities
\begin{equation}\label{g1}
\begin{array}{c}
\text{representations}\\\text{of $\ket\Xi$"=state}
\end{array}\![5]\mbig[7]\}:\qquad
\frak a_1\,\bet{\alpha_1}\+\frak a_2\,\bet{\alpha_2}\+\cdots=
\frak b_1\,\bet{\beta_1}\+\frak b_2\,\bet{\beta_2}\+\cdots=
\cdots\,.
\end{equation}
They furnish \emph{representations $\ket{\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}}$,
$\ket{\Xi_{\!\sss\scr B}}$, \ldots\ of quantum state $\ket\Xi$ of
system~$\cal S$}. By design, the \texttt{DataSource} object $\ket\Xi$
carries data $\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}$, $\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr B}$ and,
more generally, $\obj\Xi$"=data \eqref{set''} from the arrays of
\emph{any} observations, including the imaginary ones. That is what
eliminates the initial need for the $\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}$"=brace
\eqref{obj} to be came from the observation $\scr A$, which is
reflected in the shortening of the term `representation of state' to
simply `state' $\ket\Xi$. It should be added that the
straightforward storing of objects $\{\ket{\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}}$,
$\ket{\Xi_{\!\sss\scr B}}$, \ldots\} in a certain set \itsf{H}, but with
the independence of operations \{$\+^{\![3]\sss(\scr A)}$,
$\+^{\![3]\sss(\scr B)}$, \ldots\} preserved, would not differ from the
tautological substitution of symbols. Accordingly, the semantic
autonomy of $\obj{\state\Xi}$"=brace would be inherited, whereas
invariance~\hyperlink{III}{\red\textbf{\textsf{III}}} requires the
elimination of precisely this autonomy. What is more, the
set"=theoretic original copy for operations
\{$\overset{\raisebox{-0.21ex}{$\,\,\sss\smash[b]{\scr A}$}}{\uplus}$,
$\overset{\raisebox{-0.21ex}{$\sss\smash[b]{\scr B}$}}{\uplus}$,
\ldots\} and $\+$ is one and the same---the union~$\cup$.

The symbols $\bet{\alpha_s}$ and $\bet{\beta{}_s}$ in \eqref{g1} are
no more than symbols. Hence the objects' property \eqref{g1} of
being identical must be reflected in terms of their coordinate
$\frak a,\frak b$"=components; pt.~\hyperlink{R}{\red\textsf{R}}$(\bullet)$.
This means that any aggregate $(\frak a_1$, $\frak a_2$, \ldots) is
unambiguously calculated by means of a certain transformation
$\oper[-1]U$ into any other $(\frak b_1$, $\frak b_2$, \ldots), when
the two aggregates represent a common~$\ket\Xi$:
\begin{equation*}
(\frak a_1,\frak a_2,\ldots)=\oper[-1]U (\frak b_1,\frak b_2,\ldots)\,.
\end{equation*}
The $\oper[-1]U$ then becomes an isomorphism between these
aggregates and, accordingly, their lengths must coincide. This
length---a certain single constant---will be symbolized as~\texttt{D}.

\subsection{Representations of devices. Spectra}

Naturally, instrument is converted to the \itsf{H}"=structure
language along with $\obj\Xi$"=objects. It is a set of symbols
$\{\bet{\gamma_1}$, $\bet{\gamma_2}$, \ldots\} in place of the previous
$\{\state\gamma_1$, $\state\gamma_2$, \ldots\}. As has just been shown,
their number for any $\scr C$"=instrument should be equal to \texttt{D}.
However, generally speaking,
$|\boT_{\sss\scr A}|\ne|\boT_{\sss\scr B}|$, since
$\boT_{\sss\scr A}$ and $\boT_{\sss\scr B}$ are assigned in an
arbitrary way (pt.~\hyperlink{O}{\red\textsf{O}}). Therefore if we take
an illustration $\scr A\{\state\alpha_1,\state\alpha_2\}$ and
$\scr B\{\state\beta_1,\state\beta_2,\state\beta_3\}$, then
\itsf{H}"=representation of instrument $\scr A$ should appear at
least as $\{\bet{\alpha_1},\bet{\alpha_2},\bet{\alpha_3}\}$.
Clearly, the already present distinguishability
$\state\alpha_1\not\approx\state\alpha_2$ (sect.~\ref{observ}) is
automatically converted into an abstract distinguishability of new
symbols $\bet{\alpha_1}\ne\bet{\alpha_2}$, and empirical
$\scr A$"=distinguishability is confined exclusively by these two
symbols. In that case, for the purpose of noncontradiction, the
added third symbol $\bet{\alpha_3}$, as an adjunction to the
abstract relations $\bet{\alpha_3}\ne\bet{\alpha_1}$ and
$\bet{\alpha_3}\ne\bet{\alpha_2}$, should be complemented with the
notion of its physical \emph{in}discernibility from $\bet{\alpha_1}$
or $\bet{\alpha_2}$. By an extension of this argument one gets that
every $\scr A$"=instrument should be endowed with the
(non)equivalence relation (${\Bumpeq}/{\not\Bumpeq}$) in terms of
the \itsf{H}"=structure by its formal
$\{\bet{\alpha_1},\ldots\}$"=representations. How to do this?

Let us proceed further from a self"=suggested extension of
pt.~\hyperlink{R}{\red\textsf{R}}. Let us declare---and it is more than
natural---that the numeric representations $\alpha_s$ are linked not
only to observations, but to instruments as well. Each $\alpha_s$ is
the new object of a numeric type: a number or a collection of
numbers. Then, indiscernibility, say
$\bet{\alpha_3}\bumpeq\bet{\alpha_1}$, is recorded by coincidence of
the numeric labels $\alpha_3=\alpha_1$ attached to the symbols
$\bet{\alpha_3}$ and $\bet{\alpha_1}$ respectively. The abstract
(`old') distinguishability $\bet{\alpha_3}\ne\bet{\alpha_1}$,
meanwhile, remains as it is. From these we have the following
formalization of relationship between $\bumpeq$ and $=$ by means of
dropping/""adding the brackets~$\bet{\ }$:
\begin{equation}\label{spectr}
\left.
\begin{aligned}
\bet{\alpha_s}\not
\bumpeq\bet{\alpha_k}\quad&\hhence\quad\alpha_s\ne\alpha_k\\
\bet{\alpha_s}
\bumpeq\bet{\alpha_k}\quad&\hhence\quad\alpha_s=\alpha_k
\end{aligned}
\right\}\quad\text{under}\quad \bet{\alpha_s}\ne\bet{\alpha_k}\,.
\end{equation}
Call the quantity $\alpha_s$ (numeric) \emph{spectral label/""marker}
of eigen"=element $\bet{\alpha_s}$. Then, by
\itsf{H}-\emph{representation $\bo[\scr A\bo]$ of instrument}
$\scr A$ we will mean the set of objects $\big\{\bet{\alpha_1}$,
\ldots, $\bet{\alpha_{\texttt{D}}}\big\}$ supplemented with the spectral
structure~\eqref{spectr}:
\begin{equation}\label{spectr-}
\bo[\scr A\bo]\DEF\big\{\bet{\alpha_1}_{{\sss\lfloor}\alpha_1^{}},\,
\bet{\alpha_2}_{{\sss\lfloor}\alpha_2^{}},\, \ldots\big\}\,.
\end{equation}
It is not difficult to see that if
$\bet{\alpha_1}\not\bumpeq\bet{\alpha_2}$ then either
$\bet{\alpha_3}\bumpeq\bet{\alpha_1}$ or
$\bet{\alpha_3}\bumpeq\bet{\alpha_2}$. Otherwise, spectral markers
$\vcenter{\Smaller[3]\lfloor}\alpha_1=\vcenter{\Smaller[3]\lfloor}
\alpha_2$ should coincide, and primary primitives
$\state\alpha_1\not\approx\state\alpha_2$ lose their empirical
distinguishability in contrast with \eqref{a1122}. Multiple
coincidence of $\vcenter{\Smaller[3]\lfloor}\alpha_s$"=markers is
acceptable.

In the presence of relations \eqref{spectr}, it is natural to state
that instrument $\scr A$ is coarser (more symmetrical) than
$\scr B$, and, terminologically, to declare that the degeneration of
the spectral"=label values takes place. In cases of embeddability
like $\scr A_2\{\state\alpha_1,\state\alpha_2\}\subset
\scr A_3\{\state\alpha_1,\state\alpha_2,\state\alpha_3\}$,
instrument $\scr A_2$ can even be called the same as (coinciding
with) $\scr A_3$, but with a more rough scale. Or conversely,
$\scr A_3$ is a more precise extension of $\scr A_2$. In particular,
the natural notion of a device resolution fits here.

All instruments may then be mathematically imagined as having the
same resolution, but, perhaps, with degeneration of spectra. The
non"=coinciding instruments may be interpreted as non"=equivalent
reference frames $\scr A\ne\scr B$ in an observation space.
According to pts.~\hyperlink{R}{\red\textsf{R}}$(\bullet\bullet)$ and
\hyperlink{III}{\red\textbf{\textsf{III}}}, they are mandatorily present
in the description. The spectral degenerations are also present at
all times, since element $\state\alpha_1$ can always be removed from
$\boT_{\!\sss\scr A}$, and there are no logical foundations to
prohibit an observational instrument with family
$\boT_{\!\sss\scr A}-\{\state\alpha_1\}$. Hence it follows that
introducing the spectra---instrumental readings---is required even
formally, without physics. It is of course implied here that
spectral (in)discernibility is realized in the same manner as its
statistical counterpart in sects.~\ref{2.6} and \ref{whyC}, \ie, by
numbers. Incidentally, such a property of
$\vcenter{\Smaller[3]\lfloor}\alpha_s$---\ie, of being a numeric
type object---is not at all necessary at the moment. Spectrum
$\{\vcenter{\Smaller[3]\lfloor}\alpha_1,\vcenter{\Smaller[3]\lfloor}
\alpha_2,\ldots\}$ may be thought of as an abstract set of labels
attached to the eigen"=elements. As numbers, it is introduced for the
subsequent creation of models to classical/""macroscopic dynamic, and
they are numeric.

Returning to \texttt{D}, we note that, in any case, the toolkit
$\{\scr A,\scr B,\ldots\}\FED\cal O$ in real use has always been
defined, fixed, and is finite. Consequently, the constant
\begin{equation}\label{D}
\texttt{D}\geqslant2
\end{equation}
has also been defined and fixed, and it becomes the globally static
observable characteristic; an empirically external parameter.
Meanwhile, the entire scheme internally contains the natural method
of its own extension $\texttt{D}\mapsto\texttt{D}+1$, and the potentially
all"=encompassing choice $\texttt{D}=\infty$ may be considered the
universally preferable one in quantum theory. By freezing the
different $\texttt{D}<\infty$, the theory makes it possible to create
models, and they are not only admissible but also well-known. Their
efficiency is examined in experiments. Once again, the
\texttt{D}"=constant, notion of spectra, and their degenerations are
created by the ($\scr A, \scr B$)"=invariance requirement, \ie, by
pr.~\hyperlink{III}{\red\textbf{\textsf{III}}}.

As a result, the structure of \itsf{H}"=representations of states and
of instruments are liberated from the arbitrariness in assigning the
subsets $\boT_{\!\sss\scr A}$ in \eqref{shema}. The statistical
unitary pre"=images \eqref{min} and \itsf{H}"=elements of the form
$\frak c\,\bet{\gamma_s}$ can be associated with any `eigen symbol'
$\bet{\gamma_s}$. They are always available because all kinds of
brace \eqref{split'} are known to contain subfamilies when ingoing
$\statePsi,\statePhi$"=primitives get to a single one, \eg, to
$\state\gamma_1$. Therefore every representation
$\frak a_1\,\bet{\alpha_1}\+\cdots$ is always equivalent to a
$\obj{\state\Xi}_{\!\sss\scr C}$"=brace for some observation $\scr C$
with a homogeneous outgoing ensemble
$\{\state\gamma_1\cdots\state\gamma_1\}$. That is, one may always
write
\begin{equation}\label{eigen}
\frak a_1\,\bet{\alpha_1}\+\frak a_2\,\bet{\alpha_2}\+\cdots=
\frak c_1\,\bet{\gamma_1}\+0\,\bet{\gamma_2}\+\cdots
\FED\frak c_1\,\bet{\gamma_1}\,,
\end{equation}
while naturally referring to $\frak c_1\,\bet{\gamma_1}$ as one of
the \emph{eigen"=states of instrument} $\scr C$, with an appropriate
adjusting the similar definition in pt.~\hyperlink{O}{\red\textsf{O}}.
The construction of the representation"=state space is far from being
complete, since it is still a `bare' semigroup~\itsf{H}.

\subsection{Superposition of states}\label{ssuper}

Since writings \eqref{g1} exist for any ensemble $\obj\Xi$"=brace,
let us consider the following two representations:
\begin{equation}\label{ab}
\begin{aligned} \frak a_1\,\bet{\alpha_1}\+
\frak a_2\,\bet{\alpha_2}&=\frak b_1\,\bet{\beta_1}\+\frak b_2\,
\bet{\beta_2}\+\cdots\,,\\
\frak a_2\,\bet{\alpha_2}&=
\frak b_1'\,\bet{\beta_1}\+\frak b_2'\,\bet{\beta_2}\+\cdots\,.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Comparison of these equalities tells us that the second one is a
solution of the first one with respect to
$\frak a_2\,\bet{\alpha_2}$. Hence, the semigroup operation $\+$
admits a cancellation of element $\frak a_1\,\bet{\alpha_1}$. This
means that there exists an element
$\tilde{\frak a}_1\,\bet{\alpha_1}$ such that
\begin{Align*}
\big\{\tilde{\frak a}_1\,\bet{\alpha_1}\+
\frak a_1\,\bet{\alpha_1}\big\}\+\frak a_2\,\bet{\alpha_2}&=
\tilde{\frak a}_1\,\bet{\alpha_1}\+\big\{\frak b_1\,\bet{\beta_1}
\+\frak b_2\,\bet{\beta_2}\+\cdots\big\}
\\[-1ex]&\,\,\Downarrow\\[-1ex]
0\,\bet{\alpha_1}\+ \frak a_2\,\bet{\alpha_2}&=\tilde{\frak a}_1\,
\bet{\alpha_1}\+\frak b_1\,\bet{\beta_1}\+\frak b_2\,
\bet{\beta_2}\+\cdots\\[-1ex]&\,\,\Downarrow\quad
\text{(due to \eqref{eigen})}\\[-1ex]
\frak a_2\,\bet{\alpha_2}&=\frak b_1'\,
\bet{\beta_1}\+\frak b_2'\,\bet{\beta_2}\+\cdots
\\\Downarrow\qquad\quad&\qquad\quad\Downarrow\\
\text{\makebox[0em][r]{$\bet{0}\DEF0\,\bet{\alpha_1}=
\tilde{\frak a}_1\,\bet{\alpha_1}\+ \frak a_1\,
\bet{\alpha_1}$}}\,,\quad&\qquad
\text{\makebox[0em][l]{$\tilde{\frak a}_1\,\bet{\alpha_1}\+
\frak b_1\,\bet{\beta_1}\+\cdots=\frak b_1'\,
\bet{\beta_1}\+\cdots\,,$}}
\end{Align*}
where $\bet{0}$ stands for a zero in semigroup \itsf{H} (image
$\obj0$ of the finite length brace $\obj{\state\Xi}$) and 0 in
$0\,\bet{\alpha_1}$ is a symbol of its $[\lambda,\mu]$"=coordinates.
By canceling out $\frak a_s\,\bet{\alpha_s}$, one by one, if
necessary, one deduces that any element of \itsf{H} does have an
inversion. That is, \itsf{H} is actually a group. We re"=denote
inverse elements $\tilde{\frak a}_s\,\bet{\alpha_s}$ by
$(-\frak a_s)\,\bet{\alpha_s}$ and inversions of sums are formed from
$(\+)$"=sums thereof. Moreover, all the $[\lambda,\mu]$"=pairs turn
into a set $\{\frak a,\frak b, \ldots\}$ equipped with the above
mentioned composition $\oplus$, which follows from an obvious
property of unitary brace:
\begin{equation}\label{s20}
\frak a\,\bet{\alpha_1}\+ \frak b\,\bet{\alpha_1}=
(\frak a\oplus\frak b)\,\bet{\alpha_1}
\end{equation}
(inheritance of clossedness under the $\cup$"=operation). This
composition is also a $\oplus$"=operation of a group and of a
commutative one:
\begin{equation}\label{g+}
\frak a\oplus\frak b=\frak b\oplus\frak a\,,\qquad
(\frak a\oplus\frak b)\oplus\frak c=\frak a\oplus
(\frak b\oplus\frak c)\,,\qquad\frak a\oplus0=\frak a\,,\qquad
\frak a\oplus(-\frak a)=0\,.
\end{equation}
Therefore the group nature of semigroup \itsf{H} and the group
\eqref{g+} come from the scheme
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{\begin{array}{c}
\ds \bigg\{\begin{array}{c}
\text{single observations}\\

\end{array}\bigg\} \quad\hence\quad
\big\{\text{group \itsf{H}}\big\}
\end{array}}
\end{equation*}
and, technically, from equatings/""identifyings~\eqref{g1}.

Thus handling the $\ket\Xi$"=objects breaks free from its ties to the
notion of observation, and the objects admit the formal writings
$\frak a\,\bet\Psi\+\frak b\,\bet\Phi\+\cdots$. Call them
\emph{superpositions}. However, as soon as they or the state are
associated in meaning with the word `readings' (it is discussed at
greater length in sects.~\ref{phys}, \ref{2slit}), this term should
be replaced with a non"=truncated one: representation of the state
with respect to a certain observation. In particular, the
statistical data $\nu_j$ are obtained from such expressions only
after their conversion into a sum over eigen"=states of the form
\eqref{g1}; a task of the subsequent mathematical tool. No
superposition $\frak a\,\bet\Psi\+\frak b\,\bet\Phi\+\cdots$, among
them \eqref{eigen}, has any physical sense in and of itself
\cite[p.~137]{silverman}, \cite{englert} nor is it preferable to any
other one. It merely reflects the closedness of states with respect
to operation $\+$, since any $\ket\Xi$ is re"=recorded as a sum of
various \{$\frak a\,\bet\Psi$, $\frak b\,\bet\Phi$, \ldots\} in a
countless number of ways and is linked to any other such sum.
Without a system of $\bet{\alpha_s\!}$"=symbols for instrument
$\scr A$, nothing observable out of the aggregate of coefficients
$\{\pm\frak a$, $\pm\frak b$, \ldots\} (and, of course, of the
$\bet\Psi$"=letters themselves) is extractable in any imaginable way.
Accordingly, it is incorrect to speak of---and that is a widespread
misconception---the destruction of the superposition or of the
``relative"=phase information'' \cite[p.~253]{schloss}, associating the
word destruction with physical/""observational meanings or processes.

As a result, \emph{even without having a numeric theory yet} and
without resorting to the concept of a physical
quantity---superposition may not address whatever physical concepts,
we arrive at the paramount property, which characterizes the most
general type of micro"=observation's ensembles~\eqref{quant}.
\begin{itemize}
\item \embf{Superposition principle.}

 A $(\+)$"=composition of quantum states $\frak a\,\bet\Psi$ and
 $\frak b\,\bet\Phi$, which are admissible for system $\cal S$, is an
 admissible state
 \begin{equation}\label{s1}
 \frak a\,\bet\Psi\+\frak b\,\bet\Phi=\frak c\,\bet\Xi\,,
 \end{equation}
 and with that the set $\big\{\frak a\,\bet\Psi,\frak b\,\bet\Phi,
 \frak c\bet\Xi,\ldots\big\}\FED\itsf{H}$ forms a commutative group
 with respect to operation $\+$. The family
 $\{\frak a,\frak b,\ldots\}$ of coordinate $\bbR^2$"=representatives of
 states \eqref{g1} is also equipped with the same group structure
 under the $\oplus$"=operation \eqref{g+} and with rule of carrying
 the operation $\+$ over to~$\oplus$:
 \begin{equation}\label{s2}
 \frak a\,\bet\Psi\+\frak b\,\bet\Psi=
 (\frak a\oplus\frak b)\,\bet\Psi\,.
 \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

Let us clarify the transferring \eqref{s20} to \eqref{s2}. The union
of the state prototypes $\frak a\,\bet\Psi$,
$\frak b\,\bet\Psi\in\itsf{H}$ is known to belong to $\frak G$. So
the composition $\frak a\,\bet\Psi\+\frak b\,\bet\Psi$ should be
identical to a certain element $\frak c\,\bet\Psi\in\itsf{H}$. It is
clear that $\frak c$ depends on $\frak a$, $\frak b$ and, hence,
$\frak a\,\bet\Psi\+\frak b\,\bet\Psi=
\frak c(\frak a,\frak b)\,\bet\Psi$. The exhaustive properties of
dependence $\frak c(\frak a,\frak b)$ are given by formulas
\eqref{g+} and \eqref{s2} under notation
$\frak c(\frak a,\frak b)\FED(\frak a\oplus\frak b)$.

\subsubsection{`Physics' of superposition}\label{cat}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{\qquad\qquad `Physics' of superposition}

Besides the essential non"=physical nature of the
($\+$)"=su\-per\-po\-si\-tions---``we cannot recognize them''
\cite[p.~13]{englert}, the primary and typical property of quantum
addition is in the fact that, due to subtraction, it is possible the
experimental obtainment of a `quantum zero' in statistics from
`non"=zeroes'. With that, the `non"=zeroes seem' to be positive, but
there are `negative non"=zeroes'---negative numbers (sect.~\ref{92}).
Subtraction manifests by the typical obscurations in interference
pictures. S.~Aaronson: ``We've got minus signs, and so we've got
interference'' \cite[p.~220]{aaronson+}. No classical composition
\begin{equation}\label{w1w2}
w\,\varrho_1^{}+(1-w)\,\varrho_2^{}
\end{equation}
of non"=zero statistics $\varrho_1^{}$, $\varrho_2^{}$ can provide a
zero value, since the zero will never be obtained via the
$\cup$"=unions. The same is true for the pre"=superposition in
isolated brace $\obj\Xi_{\!\sss\scr A}$, \ie, when one instrument is
in question.

\begin{comment}\label{Qcat}
One cannot but mention yet another counterexample to the
superposition's `physi\-ca\-li\-ty'---`the infamous quantum cat'. Any
combination of the dead and living animal is meaningless as a
statement about new/""nonclassical entity like a `(half-)dead/alive
cat' or about thinking of a `particle as being both here and not
here'; especially with the addition `at the same point in time' (see
pr.~\hyperlink{I}{\red\textbf{\textsf{I}}}). It makes absolutely no sense
to add (`ostensibly in accord with' the character~$\h+$) the absent
nature's phenomena to each other.
\begin{itemize}
\item \embf{What's being added is states, not their
 names\look[?designations, denotations?]} \emph{or verbal
 descriptions of envisioned \emph{(`fantasized', ``fantastic
 phantoms'' \cite[p.~15]{englert})} physical properties} like `spin
 up/""down' or `dead/""alive'. Cf.~\cite[pp.~134(!), 135]{maudlin}.
\end{itemize}
The `cat-box open' is a click, not state. Accordingly, the word
combination ``system is in a superposition'' is, at most, an
interpretative allegory (sect.~\ref{interpret}) without physical and
mathematical content. That is to say, strictly speaking,
\begin{itemize}
\item no quantum (micro)system `has ever been/""dwelled in any state',
 much less in a superposition one, and much less at an instant $t$.
 G.~Ludwig, on pp.~16 and 78 of the book \cite{ludwig5}, insists
 that it is a ``myth'' and ``a fairy tale, \ldots\ the very widespread
 idea that each microsystem has a real state \ldots\ represented by a
 vector in a Hilbert space'' and M.~Nielsen remarks in
 \cite{nielsen}: ``Saying $0.6\,\ket{{}0}+0.8\,\ket{{}1}$ is
 simultaneously $0$ and $1$ makes about as much sense as Lewis
 Carroll's nonsense poem \emph{Jabberwocky}: \ldots''.
\end{itemize}
Meaning of the word `add' is still being created and implemented at
objects to be thought of as `atomic irreducible' entities---numbers
(sect.~\ref{Numbers}).

T.~Maudlin notes on p.~133 of the work \cite{maudlin}: ``Our job \ldots\
is to invent mathematical representations \ldots, rather than merely
linguistic terms such as ``$z$-up.'' \ldots\ we are in some danger of
\emph{confusing physical items with mathematical items}'' (italics
supplied). Here is an example of confusion. If we are going to
measure the $x$"=spin in one of the $z_\pm$"=beams in a Stern--Gerlach
device, then why and when does this `\emph{observable}'
determinacy---say, $\ket{{}{\rightarrow}_z}$---get turned into an
$x$"=uncertainty $\ket{{}{\uparrow}}+ \ket{{}{\downarrow}}$? (see
\cite[p.~232]{ballentine+}). But what if we are going not to do
this? What do we mean by an equal sign in the writing
$\ket{{}{\rightarrow}_z}=\ket{{}{\uparrow}}+ \ket{{}{\downarrow}}$?
Where does the system `intend' to get into: the $x$"=uncertainty or
the $z$"=determinacy? Which of the states it is in, after all?
Examples to the `physicality of states' may be continued endlessly
\cite{barrett2}.
\end{comment}

A statement about \qm"=superposition (without $\bbC$"=numbers) as a
non"=independent axiom can be found in the book \cite[p.~108]{jauch1}
but arguments given there are circular: Hilbert space
$\rightarrowtail$ quantum logic of propositions $\rightarrowtail$
superposition principle. Similarly, in the works \cite{piron} and
\cite[p.~164]{beltrametti}, all of that is `derived' from modular
lattices \cite{birkh}. However, the lattices are known to come into
\qm\ from the Hilbert space structure and, on the other hand, the
purging\OK\ \qm"=rudiments of such a space' axiomatics constitutes
Birkhoff's 110-th problem \cite[p.~~286]{birkh}. Note also that, in
connection with formal logic approaches to theory construction
\cite{beltrametti, foulis, jauch1, laloe, piron, varadar, zierler},
the issue of vindicating the \emph{matters} that this logic deals
\emph{with} \cite{ludwig5, ludwig3, spekkens} should not be
neglected. (``For example, would one have to develop a quantum set
theory?'' \cite[p.~17]{edwards}.) A.~Stairs: ``If by ``logic'' we mean
something like ``correct reasoning,'' then it would make no sense to
think of logic as ``just another theory.'' \cite[p.~258]{stairs}. The
more so as the the abstract micro"=event's statistics and Boolean
logic we have used in metamathematical reasoning at the moment
\cite[pp.~189, 193]{ludwig1} contain nothing that depends on
classical physics. See also \cite[p.~29]{foulis0}.

\subsubsection{Whence non-commutativity?}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{\qquad\qquad Whence non-commutativity?}

Yet another fact that results from the above constructs is that the
availability of a superposition math"=structure \eqref{s1} reflects
the presence of at least \emph{two} $\scr A$, $\scr B$ with
\emph{non"=coinciding} families of eigen"=primitives
$\{\state\alpha_s\}$, $\{\state\beta_k\}$. This consequence of
pt.~\hyperlink{R}{\red\textsf{R}}$(\bullet\bullet)$ should be particularly
emphasized, since in the future it will manifest in the
\emph{non"=commutativity} of operators $\hA$ and $\hB$. Even though
this work does not get to operators as a mathematical structure, it
is clear that the emergent eigen"=states and spectra have a direct
bearing on them. In this context, the `commuting instruments'
$\{\bet{\alpha_1},\bet{\alpha_2},\ldots\}=
\{\bet{\beta_1},\bet{\beta_2},\ldots\}$ can be treated, roughly
speaking, as coinciding, because this fact is independent of the
specific spectrums $\{\vcenter{\Smaller[3]\lfloor}\alpha_1,
\vcenter{\Smaller[3]\lfloor}\alpha_2,\ldots\}$,
$\{\vcenter{\Smaller[3]\lfloor}\beta_1,
\vcenter{\Smaller[3]\lfloor}\beta_2,\ldots\}$ assigned to them. If they
differ, this is merely a different (numeric) graduation of the
spectrum scale. It is the same for all instruments, and its length
is the parameter~\texttt{D}.

Notice that definition of an $\scr A$"=observation is not different
from the formal assignment of the family $\boT_{\!\sss\scr A}$
(pt.~\hyperlink{O}{\red\textsf{O}} and \eqref{shema}), which is why the
non"=coinciding sets $\boT_{\!\sss\scr A}$, $\boT_{\!\sss\scr B}$ do
always exist. This provides a kind of abstractly deductive
existence's proof for the non"=commutativity, \qm"=interference---see
further below sect.~\ref{2slit}---and for the `utmost low"=level
finality' of \qm\ altogether \cite{ludwig3, gottfried, auletta}. The
whys and wherefores of theory do not require invoking the physical
conceptions; cf.~\cite[p.~2]{landau}. Of no small importance is that
this point entails an independence of the classical physics or its
formal deformation, which are yet to be created from the quantum one
(cf.~a selected thesis on page~\pageref{ClassQuant}). In particular,
no use is required of the notion of a certain pretty small---again
the classical/""physical term---quantity, \ie, the Plank
constant~$\hbar$. What is more, the quantum paradigm
\eqref{quant}--\eqref{grubo} tells us that the classical description
begins---\ie, we do create/""introduce---with the notions of a
micro"=event's average and of time, whereas these conceptions are yet
absent at the moment; and in the present work.

\subsection{Physical properties}\label{phys}

Now, the `general physics' $\SM$ is mathematized into
representations \eqref{g1} of states $\ket\Xi$ of system $\cal S$.
There is, however, an ambiguity, the source of which is the fact
that the natural/""classical language also lays claims to a similar
formulation. This refers to the belief in the existence of
mathematics (`bad habit' \cite{mermin}; see also \cite{zeilinger},
\cite[p.~122]{ludwig5}, and \cite{mermin2}) that describes $\cal S$
as an individual object with properties regardless of observation;
an observation that is not a \emph{functioning} attribute of the
mathematics itself. In classical description, it is specified by
definitions: point $\point P$ of a phase space,
$(q,p)$"=coordinatization of the point (manifold), and statistical
distribution~$\varrho(q,p)$.

On the other hand, quantum empiricism provides nothing more to us
besides the ensemble brace and $\ket\Xi$"=states
(pt.~\hyperlink{T}{\red\textsf{T}}). Preordained definienda with
physical contents are unacceptable, \ie, $\cal S$ should not be
conceived as `something with \emph{physical} properties' or as an
`\emph{individual} object' \cite[p.~645]{peres0}, \cite{ludwig3,
ludwig4}. However, since the observational data (in the broadest
sense of the word) may not originate from anywhere but a certain
$\ket\Xi$"=object, there should subsequently create
\begin{itemize}
\item[1)] the very concept of physical properties
 \cite[pp.~211--230]{wart}
\item[2)] and their numeric values/""characteristics.
\end{itemize}
This is habitually referred to as elements/""images of reality
\cite[pp.~194]{greenstein}, \cite[sect.~10.2]{allah},
\cite[\S\,XIII.4.8]{ludwig4}---Bell's ``beables'' \cite{bell}, or what we
have been calling attributes of a physical system. M.~Wartofsky:
``The very notion of 'phenomenon' or of 'the appearance of things,'
\ldots\ is a cognitive and perceptual act of abstraction''
\cite[p.~220]{wart}. The physical phenomena per~se do not exist
\cite{brukner}, \cite[p.~310]{ludwig2}.

Indeed, the primary ideology of sects.~\ref{physmath} and \ref{S}
tells us that an invasion of physically self"=apparent images into
the theory should be avoided \cite[p.~69]{ludwig1}, because ``quantum
theory not only does not use---it does not even dare to
mention---the notion of a ``real physical situation'' (E.~Jaynes
\cite[p.~198]{greenstein}). Therefore everything, with no
exceptions, should be (mathematically) created: coordinates/""momenta,
energies, optical spectra, device readings, sizes, number/""numeration
of particles (Fock space), their (in)discernibility/""individuality
(bosons/""fermions), the notion of a subsystem of system $\cal S$
(see~\eqref{m2}), \etc.

Degrees of freedom and the numeric forms of what is known as the
classical reference frames---coordinates on manifolds---need also to
be created. This fact is required for careful posing the questions
regarding the quantum gravity, and it should be noted in passing
that the `simultaneity' is the ill"=defined term not only in the
(general) relativity theory but in \qm\ as well;
pr.~\hyperlink{I}{\red\textbf{\textsf{I}}} and \cite{ludwig1}. The concept
of a (non"=elementary) particle\footnote{By a particle is meant here
the classical kinematic conception. R.~Haag (2013): ``What do we
detect? The presence of a particle? Or the occurrence of a
microscopic event?''. H.~Zeh and G.~Ludwig answer: ``There are no
particles in reality'' \cite{zeh}, ``we must abandon the notion of a
microscopic ``object'', one to which we have accustomed''
\cite[p.~69]{ludwig1}.}, which is conceptually close to the notion
of a subsystem/part, is also a physical convention, and can only
arise from the $\ket\Xi$ or its models: Bose"=condensates,
deformation excitations in crystal lattices, quasi"=particles in a
superfluid phase, quantum theories of various fields (relativistic
or non), and more. Clearly, the \qft{}s is a subclass of \qm"=theory,
and not its extension. In particular, it is common knowledge in
\qft\ that no logical way to distinguish a particle from a certain
state---normally, a vacuum excitation---exists. One word should
therefore be used for both. In this regard, the well-known problem
of dualism is eliminated because both the particles and waves are
the classical notions, and in quantum language, they turn into the
derivatives of the notions of state and mixture \eqref{m2}. Like
waves, \emph{the particle is already a phenomenon}---an observable
one (phenomenology), which is why it may not exist \cite{zeh} prior
to theory's principles. Note that the $\nu$"=statistics also falls
under observable quantities, and constant
$\texttt{D}$\footnote{Dimension of a state space to come. A tensorial
structure of this space---compound systems---pertains directly to
the physical properties but we do not touch upon this point here. As
an aside, this compositional structure will provide the means of
distinguishing the aforementioned models under $\texttt{D}=\infty$.},
if declared finite, is an example of an already created
characteristic.

In other words, the logic of the above constructs prohibits not only
the endowing the terms `internal state of an individual object
$\cal S$' and `the system is in a (definite) state'
\cite{ludwig3}--\cite{ludwig5}, \cite{muynck} with meaning, but also
the indirect using their numerical forms. That would work in
circumvention of empiricism, assuming the a~priori availability of
mathematical structures that do not rely on the state space.
L.~Ballentine remarks in this regard: ``the habit of considering an
individual particle to have its own wave function is hard to break''
\cite[p.~238]{ballentine2}; cf.~``To speak of a single possible
initial apparatus state is pure fantasy'' (N.~Graham
\cite[pp.~241--242]{dewitt}).

\subsection{Interference}\label{2slit}

Let us go on with comments as to the involving the
\emph{physics"=related} argumentation in the explication of quantal
behavior. We have already mentioned above that for this purpose
there is simply no language of physics (see
sects.~\ref{S},~\ref{phys}) and of mathematics yet (see
sects.~\ref{makenumb},~\ref{EmpMath}). That is why analogies of this
sort are not only deceptive, but must be prohibited for exactly the
same reasons that accompanied boxes \eqref{box}. The typical
examples in this connection are the notion of a simultaneous
measurability and the 2-slit interference \cite{silverman, accardi}.

First and foremost, the two cases---whether one or two slits are
open---are quite ``different experimental arrangements''
\cite[p.~236]{ballentine+}
\begin{equation*}
\SM'\ne \SM''\,.
\end{equation*}
There is nowhere to seek a means of their comparison or the
transference of one into another \cite[p.~236]{ballentine+}.
Nonetheless, the classical approach, when opening another slit
$\SM_2'$ together with the first one $\SM_1'$, in a literal sense,
envisions characteristics for $\SM''$ (see sect.~\ref{phys}). In
doing so, the transference method itself---`addition of two physics'
$\SM'$ by the rule of arithmetic addition of statistics
\eqref{w1w2}---is meanwhile considered self"=apparent. Thus the
natural questions, such as `why/where are the zeroes coming from,
they shouldn't be there'. In accordance with the aforesaid,
everything here is erroneous, including the `natural' questions.
There are no rules at the outset---(non)classical and even quantum,
just as there is no addition per~se. A~priori assuming them to stem
from the obvious images for $\SM_1'$ and $\SM_2'$ is, in fact, the
declaration of physical properties for $\SM''$ that, however, do not
follow from anywhere \cite[p.~55]{hren1}, \cite{szabo},
\cite{accardi}. The (illegal) assumption of the 'negligible effect
of the which-slit detectors' mentioned on p.~\pageref{which} is
identical with a declaration of a physical property or, similarly, a
solenoid's switch-on/off in the Aharonov--Bohm effect.

Taken alone, the $\varrho$"=distributions---separate for $\SM_1'$ and
$\SM_2'$---are entirely correct observational pictures, but
introducing the rule \eqref{w1w2} is indistinguishable from
`invention' of physics\footnote{D.~Slavnov: ``\ldots\ to invent the
physical exegesis of a \ldots\ mathematical scheme''
\cite[p.~304]{slavnov2}. W.~de~Muynck: ``Our custom of seeing
classical mechanics as a no"=nonsense description of 'reality as it
is' does not seem to be justified. This custom is actually based on
a confusion of categories \ldots'' \cite[p.~89]{muynck}.}; a logically
prohibited operation. In other words, the mere fact of non"=adherence
to this rule means that the grammatical conjunction of the verbs `to
understand/""deduce' with the noun `micro"=phenomena' is unacceptable
even linguistically. It is the point~\hyperlink{T}{\red\textsf{T}} that
prohibits predefined (classical) semantics, and it was faithfully
summarized by C.~Fuchs: ``badly calibrated linguistics is the
predominant reason for quantum foundations continuing to exist as a
field of research'' \cite[p.~xxxix]{fuchs4}. To understand or deduce
(from mathematics) quantal phenomena is unfeasible
\cite[p.~111]{silverman} and is ``\emph{absolutely} impossible, to
explain in any classical way'' (quote by Feynman). Just as with the
elucidation of the nature of the quantum state on
p.~\pageref{smysl}, any (circum-)classical justification is
guaranteed to fail here, since it is based upon significant and
implicit assumptions.

The classical theory is a theory of \emph{observational} objects
with \emph{observational} properties expressed by
\emph{observational} numbers. We possess none of the three items
required to create the quantum (\,$=$ correct) description
(sect.~\ref{S0}). The very adjective `observational' is a linguistic
notion of the classical vocabulary (sect.~\ref{observ}).
Accordingly, the description can only be changed into `to describe
in newly created terms'. A.~Leggett notes \cite{leggett1} that which
is understood as common"=sense should also be replaced (see also
\cite[p.~10]{englert}). The reason is clear. The common"=sense
operates---and that is perfectly normal---in observational
categories rather than in structureless `microscopy' \eqref{rule}
and $\cup$"=abstractions of sect.~\ref{inv}; cf.~Bohr's
correspondence principle \cite{jammer}. In effect, we have dealt
with a `fundamental gap'\look[можно gulf; Stacey] between the right
description---``what is really going on?'' \cite[p.~12]{englert}---and
our ability to give a (naturally speaking) explanation in terms of
these categories.

\subsubsection{Detector micro-events}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{\qquad\qquad Detector micro-events}

For similar reasons, we cannot think (or envision) that a particle
in an interferometer `flies through the slit', `has (not) arrived',
``is located somewhere in the region of space'' \cite[p.~7]{dirac}
`now/later', `here, not there', that `the choice of a detector has
been delayed' (Wheeler \cite{greenstein}), or that a ``photon \ldots\
interferes \ldots\ with itself'' \cite[p.~9]{dirac}, and that,
generally, `something is flying along a trajectory', and `something'
is a particle at an intuitive understanding. Cf.~Dirac's description
of ``the translational states of a photon'' in \S\,3 of \cite{dirac}.
\begin{itemize}
\item ``Photons are just clicks in photon detectors; nothing real is
 traveling from the source to the detector'' (ascribed to
 A.~Zeilinger),
\end{itemize}
and this point is supported by all the known varieties of
interferometers. We would add in turn that clicks themselves are the
clicks not \emph{of photons/""particles} but are `merely clicks';
nothing really interferes inside interferometers, nor is anything
superposed. For example, that the path of photons is not represented
by connected trajectories was impressively demonstrated with the
nested Mach--Zehnder experimental setup in the work \cite{danan}.
Asking ``where the photons have been'' \cite{danan} is also the matter
of a certain $\state\alpha$"=distinguishability. An
interferometer---the entire installation---should be perceived as
nothing more than a black box $\SM$---the box \eqref{box}---`outside
of space and time'. This is as a kind of irreducible element that
produces the only entity---distinguishable $\state\alpha$"=events,
and no other. The box contains no `flying particles'. Say, none of
the words in the typical sentence `photon propagates a definite
path' are well"=defined. Any assessment of the screen flashes
observed within interferometer---`is zero statistics possible in any
spot?'---lacks meaning until the theory's numeric apparatus is
presented.
\begin{comment}\label{13}
Thus Young's interference of the light beams (1803) is
\emph{inherently} the quantum---not the classical---effect: a
micro"=events' accumulation termed usually as the light intensity.
The classical electromagnetism, in an exact sense, does not explain
but only describes the phenomenon quantitatively with use of the
numeric concepts of the positive and, which is important, the
negative values of observable strength"=fields $\vec{\bo E}$ and
$\vec{\bo H}$. Accordingly, operations of their addition/""subtraction
`rephrase' the effect in words ``superposing, suppressing, waves,
intensities'', and we call this `explanation'. (The negativity with
numbers is specifically commented on further in sect.~\ref{92}.) In
quantum approach, all of these concepts are not yet available, and
the phenomenon per~se is no more than the statistics of the
`positively accumulative' quantum clicks. There are not any waves
there. The same---visible with the naked eye and `explainable by
waves'--macroscopic effect would take place, if we had the `laser'
of, say, mono"=energetic slow electrons. To put it more precisely: a
gun or emitter of something we envision as `material particles
electrons, neutrons', \etc.
\end{comment}
A criticism of the typical (a common event"=space) analysis of the
2-slit experiment \cite{feynman} is already abundant in the
literature. See, for example, the works \cite{szabo}(!),
\cite[pp.~55--58]{hren1}, \cite[Ch.~2]{hren0}, \cite{fine, accardi},
\cite[p.~93]{peres}.

Summing up, it is not the quantum interference that requires
interpretative comprehension, but its classic `roughening'. In other
words, a scheme that latently presumes the rule \eqref{w1w2} of
extrapolation of what is observed in macro and micro \cite[(!)~last
sentence on p.~101]{wart}. It is this scheme---ascribing the
ontological status \cite{leifer, leggett1} to everything, and not
the quantum approach, that contradicts the logic and experience.
Pauli characterizes this as habits ``known as `ontology' or
`realism'\,\,''. Moreover, the chief component of
constructs---$\lceil$ob\-ser\-va\-tion $\rightarrowtail$
sta\-te$'$$\rceil$---is cast out and replaced with \eqref{grubo}
under such a transformation. The \texttt{DataSource} object
(p.~\pageref{datainfo}) begins to be identified with the
\emph{observational} and \emph{numeric} characteristics (see
sentences before Remark~\ref{rem4}), while the logic of the
micro-world requires the distancing of precisely these two concepts,
with no need for the characteristics themselves.

Thus we should not be deriving the physics of one phenomenon from
another \cite[p.~92]{ludwig5} and making (super)generalizations, as
soon as the incorrectness of the previous derivation method was
established.
\begin{itemize}
\item Quantum mathematics constitutes not a physical
 theory\footnote{S.~Aaronson was likely the first to advance this
 line of thought: ``\ldots\ it's \textsl{not} a physical theory in the same
 sense as electromagnetism or general relativity \ldots\ quantum
 mechanics sits at a level \textsl{between} math and physics \ldots\
 \textsl{is the operating system} \ldots'' \cite[p.~110]{aaronson+}.
 Fuchs--Peres: ``quantum theory does \emph{not} describe physical
 reality'' \cite[p.~70]{fuchs1}.}---and that is its distinguishing
 feature---but, rather, a single syntactic
 \emph{\emph{(meta)}principle of forming the mathematical models
 being subsequently turned into} (the physical) \emph{theories}.
 This principle is not subject to any (physical) treatment.
\end{itemize}
To create the models, we already have a good deal of
\emph{latitude}: the toolkit $\cal O=\{\scr A,\scr B,\ldots\}$, the
parameter \texttt{D}, the families $\{\boT_{\!\sss\scr A}$,
$\boT_{\!\sss\scr B}$, \ldots\}, numbers $\{\varrho_s\}$ of mixtures
\eqref{m2}, and---thanks to the notion of
invariance~\hyperlink{III}{\red\textbf{\textsf{III}}}---spectra, a
structure of a group, and the concept of (different) representations
of the one mathematical structure. This freedom will be subsequently
augmented with the key notions of a mean and of time $t$, and also
composite systems, the classical Lagrangians/""Hamiltonians, their
symmetries, and phenomenological constants. This is what is
currently termed as a \emph{quantization procedure} of the classical
models---quantum phenomenology; the path"=integrals, $S$"=matrix \etc.
All that remains is to examine the numeric constituent of quantum
mathematics.

The further strategy (sects.~\ref{Numbers}--\ref{minus}) lies in the
fact that the numbers need to be created at first as a theoretical
notion---arithmetic---and then as the concept of `numeric values to
observable quantities'---the observations numbers. The sections
\ref{divis}--\ref{92} contain some more explanations along these
lines.

\subsection{Replications of ensembles}\label{Dupl}

In connection with the emergence of a group, the numeric
representation of brace also undergoes change, since the `doubling'
of the semigroup into a group\footnote{Formally known as a
symmetrization of the commutative associative law (monoid)
\cite{burbaki}. Curiously, under commutativity and associativity
\cite[sect.~1.10]{clifford}, solution to the problem of embedding is
unique \cite[pp.~15--17]{burbaki}, and otherwise no solution, in
general, exists. There exist the classes (Mal'cev (1936)), which are
not axiomatized by finitely many $\forall$"=formulas
\cite[pp.~216--217]{maltsev}.} through adjoining the inversions
deprives coordinate $\frak a$ of its distinction in comparison with
the inversion $-\frak a$. Given the involution
\begin{equation}\label{unar}
-(-\frak a)=\frak a\,,
\end{equation}
it makes no difference what to call an element, and what to call its
inversion in the pair $\{\frak a,-\frak a\}$.

The aforesaid is best demonstrated by another way of `digitalizing'
the empiricism, which is realized as the infinite replication of
finite ensembles
\begin{equation}\label{dupl}
\big\{\{\statePsi\}_{\msf n}\{\statePsi\}_{\msf n}\cdots
\big\}=\big\{\{\statePsi\}_{\msf n}\big\}_\infty
\FED\{\statePsi\}_{\msf n\infty}\,.
\end{equation}
That is, empirically, any infinite ensemble is thought of as created
by repetitions (copies) of the finite objects
$\{\statePsi\}_{\msf n}$. It is in this only meaning that one should
read the writing $\Sigma\to\infty$ for the infinity postulate
\eqref{nu} (\ie, $\Sigma\times\infty$ is a relationship between the
actual and potential infinity \cite{harin, kleene}), because at the
moment we possess neither the mathematics nor the topological
concepts like a passage to the limit
$\lim\limits_{\sss\Sigma\to\infty}$. The copies, in turn, are
replications of the atomic primitive $\{\state\Psi\}_1$. Replication
is thus an operation of the same significance as $\cup$ and
$\uplus$. With it, the $\obj\Xi$"=brace is characterized by the
`numeric' combination
\begin{equation*}
\eqref{set}\quad\rightarrowtail\quad\big\{[\msf n_1\infty,\,\msf m_1\infty],\;
[\msf n_2\infty,\,\msf m_2\infty],\;\ldots\big\}
\;\rightleftarrows\;\obj\Xi
\end{equation*}
(indices label the $\state\alpha_s$"=primitives), which has been
created from the unitary brace by the scheme
\begin{equation}\label{nm'}
\eqref{min}=\mbig[13]\lgroup\![11]
\begin{array}{c}
\big\{\{\statePsi\}_{\infty'}\{\statePhi\}_{\infty''}\big\}\\
\DOWN\;\;\;\DOWN\;\;\;\DOWN\;\;\;\DOWN\\
\{\state\alpha\cdots\cdots\state\alpha\}_{\hbox to0ex{$\scs\infty$}}
\end{array}\![8] \mbig[13]\rgroup\quad\rightarrowtail\quad
\mbig[13]\lgroup\![11]
\begin{array}{c}
\big\{\{\statePsi\}_{\msf n\infty}
\{\statePhi\}_{\msf m\infty}\big\}\\
\DOWN\;\;\;\DOWN\;\;\;\DOWN\;\;\;\DOWN\\
\{\state\alpha\cdots\cdots\state\alpha\}
_{\hbox to0ex{$\scs(\msf n+\msf m)\infty$}}
\end{array}\hspace{1.3em} \mbig[13]\rgroup
\quad\rightarrowtail\quad[\msf n\infty,\msf m\infty]\,\state\alpha\,.
\end{equation}
The semigroup union $\obj{\Xi'}\uplus\obj{\Xi''}$ is then conformed
with the writing
\begin{multline}\label{nm''}
\big\{[\msf n_1'\infty,\,\msf m_1'\infty],\;[\msf n_2'\infty,\,\msf m_2'
\infty],\;\ldots\big\}\uplus\big\{[\msf n_1''\infty,\,\msf m_1''\infty],\;
[\msf n_2''\infty,\,\msf m_2''\infty],\;\ldots\big\}=\\
=\big\{[(\msf n_1'+\msf n_1'')\,\infty,\,(\msf m_1'+\msf m_1'')\,\infty],\;
[(\msf n_2'+\msf n_2'')\,\infty,\,(\msf m_2'+\msf m_2'')\,\infty],\;
\ldots\big\}\,.
\end{multline}
Moreover, the $\msf n$-, $\msf m$"=quantities may be freely thought
of as real ones due to the $\bbR^2$"=continual infinity of ensembles
proven above (sect.~\ref{whyC}). The empirical rationale of this is
apparent; namely, fractions of arbitrarily large ensembles
$\{\statePsi\,[3]\statePsi\cdots\}$.

This way of matching an infinity with the $\Sigma$"=postulate
automatically inherits the translation of
associativity/""commutativity, because the `percentages' like $s$ and
$w$, just as the rules \eqref{s'}--\eqref{NU} themselves, do not
even emerge. There, these numbers were originating from
$\Sigma$"=postulate, but it, in turn, was \emph{demolishing the pair
$(\varkappa,\frak S)$ itself} in \eqref{s}: $\frak S\to\infty$. It
is clear that, according to \eqref{nm''}, the semigroup structure
$\frak G$ is also inherited, turning into the addition of the
numeric pairs
\begin{equation}\label{oplus}
(\msf n',\msf m')\oplus(\msf n'',\msf m'')=
(\msf n'+\msf n'',\msf m'+\msf m'')\,.
\end{equation}

Returning to the group, we observe that the `negative symbols'
$(-\msf n,-\msf m)$ might be initially taken as the semigroup
$\frak G$ being duplicated, with equal success and with the same
arithmetical addition $\oplus$, while the positive $(\msf n,\msf m)$
could be considered as inversions thereof. Summing up, let us
specify the rules of passing to the numeric representations
\begin{equation}\label{nmPsi}
\eqref{min}\quad\Leftarrow\![11]=\![11]\Rightarrow\quad
\{\pm{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf p}},
\pm{\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf q}}\}\,{\state\alpha}\,,\qquad
(\msf p,\msf q)\in\bbR^2\,,
\end{equation}
and, to avoid ambiguity, let us replace the binary composition
symbol $\uplus$ with a new symbol~$\Uplus$ for
objects~\eqref{nmPsi}:
\begin{equation*}
\{{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf p}},
{\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf q}}\}\,{\state\alpha}\Uplus
\{{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf n}},
{\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf m}}\}\,{\state\alpha}\,.
\end{equation*}
The previously dropped primitives $\statePsi$, $\statePhi$ have been
restored here, since they will be further needed for theory's
invariance (sects.~\ref{C},~\ref{C*}), although they are still
unnecessary at the moment.

It is not accidental that we spoke of `numerical labeling' the brace
(p.~\pageref{labeling}), since the question of arithmetic on them
has not yet arisen. Although $\nu$"=statistics---the real
$\bbR$"=numbers---are already involved, their use was based on the
accustomed perception of a number. In accordance with
pr.~\hyperlink{II}{\red\textbf{\textsf{II}}}, the number formalization of
ensemble empiricism should be considered in greater detail.

\subsection{Number as an operator}\label{arif}

Let us begin with the classical simplification
\begin{equation}\label{setdupl}
\frak A=\big\{\{\statePsi\},\,\{\statePsi\,\statePsi\},\,
\{\statePsi\,\statePsi\,\statePsi\},\,
\{\statePsi\,\statePsi\,\statePsi\,\statePsi\},\;\ldots\big\}\,,
\end{equation}
and the notion of the number does not yet appear in any form; it
should be created (\hyperlink{II}{\red\textbf{\textsf{II}}}).

The mathematical abstracting the observation micro-acts is an
employment of the operation $\cup$ and of its closedness (see
sect.~\ref{inv}); for example,
$\{\statePsi\}\cup\{\statePsi\,\statePsi\,\statePsi\}=
\{\statePsi\,\statePsi\,\statePsi\,\statePsi\}$. All the symbols in
\eqref{setdupl}, as well as the character $\cup$, is of course
merely a convention, and they may be changed. By writing
\eqref{setdupl} in symbols like~$+$ and $\{a\,,b\,,c\,,d\,,\ldots\}$, this
set should be supplemented with identities as $a+b=c$, $b+b=d$, \ldots,
\ie, with a binary construction~$+$. Then\OK\ (semi)group and
commutative superpositions arise. Though note that the introduction
of numbers at this point---even if only as symbols---is not
necessary. It would reduce to re"=notation of the set's elements, to
be precise. But the empirical description requires their
unification, as manifested in the numeric notation like
$\{\statePsi\}\FED1\,\{\statePsi\}$, $\{\statePsi\,\statePsi\}
\FED2\,\{\statePsi\}$, \ldots. It is precisely this pattern that was
implicitly kept in mind in procedures \eqref{min}--\eqref{set} and
\eqref{dupl}--\eqref{nm'}, \ie, when introducing the numbers
$\msf n$ by means of replication of finite or infinite ensembles:
\begin{equation*}
\{\statePsi\cdots\statePsi\}_{\msf n}\;\hhence\;
\msf n\,\{\statePsi\}\,,\qquad
\big\{\{\statePsi\}_\infty\cdots\{\statePsi\}_\infty
\big\}_{\msf n}\;\hhence\;\msf n\,\{\statePsi\}\,.
\end{equation*}
The symbol $\hhence$ should read here as `the same thing as'.
Clearly, the very idea of conjunction of the two
entities---empirical brace \eqref{min} and the notion of a number
(sects.~\ref{inv},~\ref{semi})---is not otherwise implementable.
That is to say,
\begin{itemize}
\item we have no any means of translating the macro"=observations
 into the numerical language, other than through the notion of
 `quantity of something':
 \begin{equation}\label{shema'}
 \begin{array}{r@{}c@{}l}
 &\makebox[0em][c]{{\smaller[2]\DOWN\;\DOWN}\;\;
 \text{$\scr A$"=transitions}\;
 {\smaller[2]\DOWN\;\DOWN}}&\\&
 \makebox[0em][c]{$\Downarrow\qquad\Downarrow$}\\
 \makebox[0em][r]{$\lceil$`quantity of'$\rceil$}\;&&
\;\makebox[0em][l]{$\lceil$`something'$\rceil$\qquad(replication)}\\&
 \makebox[0em][c]{$\Downarrow\qquad\Downarrow$}\\
 \lceil\text{numbers}\rceil\;&&\;
 \text{$\lceil$$\statePsi$"=primitives, ensembles$\rceil$}\\
 \searrow\quad&&\quad\swarrow\\
 &\makebox[0em][c]{$\msf n\,\{\statePsi\}$}
 \end{array}\hbox to0ex{\qquad.}
 \end{equation}
\end{itemize}
Otherwise, the quantitative theory would have nowhere to originate
even at the level of the natural $\bb N$"=number characters.

On the other hand, the numerical tokens are `affixed' not only to
the `atom' $\{\statePsi\}$, but also to other objects, \emph{any
ones} at that. Therein lies the primary meaning of this, still
supra"=mathematical concept; one might even say, a definition
according to which this notion has been conceived and is being used
universally. Here are examples:
\begin{equation}\label{real}
3\,\{\statePsi\}\equiv
\{\statePsi\,\statePsi\,\statePsi\}\,,\quad
2\,\{\state\Theta\,\statePhi\}\equiv
\{\state\Theta\,\state\Theta\,\statePhi\,\statePhi\}\,,\quad
\{\statePhi\,\statePsi\}\overset{2}{\rightarrowtail}
\{\statePhi\,\statePsi\,\statePhi\,\statePsi\}\,,\quad
a\overset{3}{\rightarrowtail}3\,a\,,\quad
c\overset{1}{\rightarrowtail}1\,c\,.
\end{equation}
Accordingly, there emerge identities like $2\,b\equiv4\,a$, $3\,a\equiv
c$, $1\,c\equiv c$. In other words, as we complete simplification
\eqref{setdupl},
\begin{itemize}
\item while abstracting the empirical contents of numeric symbols,
 they should be defined as unary operations \{$\oper[-1]1$,
 $\oper[-1]2$, $\widehat{\raisebox{0.4ex}{$\scs3$}
\![3]\Smaller[2]/\![3] \raisebox{-0.4ex}{$\scs4$}}$, $\oper[-1]\pi$,
 \ldots\} that operate at the $\frak A$-set \eqref{setdupl} as
 automorphisms.
\end{itemize}

Now, replication is formalized as an operator $\oper[-1]n$ with its
numeric symbol~$\msf n$:
\begin{equation}\label{real'}
\psi\overset{\skew{1}\widehat n}{\rightarrowtail}\msf n\,\psi\,,\qquad
\psi,\, \msf n\,\psi\in\frak A\,,\qquad\msf n\in\bbR\,,
\end{equation}
where $\psi$ is understood to be any
(sub)ensemble/(sub)set\footnote{Formally, in the language of the
\zf"=theory, $\msf n\,\psi$ would be organized as an ordered pair
$(\msf n,\psi)\DEF\{\{\msf n\}, \{\msf n,\psi\}\}$ \cite{kurat},
where $\msf n$ is a cardinality of a set consisting of copies of the
object/set~$\psi$.}. We will refer to this fact as implementation of
a replication operator by numbers.

\subsection{\qm\ and arithmetic}\label{qm+A}

We immediately observe the following properties.

The operators are applicable to each other, \ie, being a family
$\{\oper[-1]n\,,\oper[-1]m,\,\oper p\,,\ldots\}$, they are closed with
respect to their composition
$\oper[-1]n\,(\oper[-1]m\,\psi)=(\oper[-1]n\circ
\oper[-1]m)\,\psi=\oper p\,\psi$, and among them, there is an
identical operator $\oper[-2]{\mathds1}\,\psi=\psi$. The empirical
meaning of the concept a fractional portion of the infinite ensemble
(see~\eqref{dupl}) tells us that for each $\oper[-1]n$ there exists
its inversion $\oper[-1]n^{\sm1}$; ``this [operator] construction
really corresponds to division'' \cite[p.~37]{baez+}. Hence, the
composition of replications $\oper[-1]n\circ\oper[-1]n^{\sm1}$ must
return the former `quantity':
$(\oper[-1]n\circ\oper[-1]n^{\sm1})\,\psi=\oper[-2]{\mathds1}\,\psi$.
As the family $\{\oper[-1]n\,,\oper[-1]m\,,\oper p\,,\ldots\}$ provides
automorphisms of the $\frak A$-set, these operators entail the
associative identities
$((\oper[-1]n\circ\oper[-1]m)\circ\oper p)\,\psi=(\oper[-1]n\circ
(\oper[-1]m\circ\oper p))\,\psi$ \cite[\S\,I.1.2]{kurosh}. The common
nature of the replication and of the $\cup$"=union also signifies
that there are relations in place that mix the actions of the unary
$\oper[-1]n$'s and the binary union of ensembles. At a minimum, one
suffices to define the action of replicator on a `$\cup$-sum' of
replications. Clearly, the case in point is a distributive
coordination of $\circ$ and~$\cup$:
\begin{equation*}
\oper p\,(\oper[-1]n\,\psi\cup\oper[-1]m\,\psi)=
(\oper p\circ\oper[-1]n)\,\psi\cup(\oper p\circ\oper[-1]m)\,\psi\,.
\end{equation*}

We now observe that the indication of $\psi$ everywhere in ensemble
identities loses both necessity and significance, and the
$\psi$"=label becomes a semblance of a dummy index or the unit symbol
[\emph{kg}], which can be changed. As we omit it, the theory is
freed of $\psi$ as of a `calculation unit'. Then the last relation,
as an example, acquires the form of a property between the operator
$\msf n$"=symbols \eqref{real'}, if $\{\cup,\circ\}$ are replaced
with the symbols of binary operations $\{+,\times\}$:
\begin{equation}\label{distr}
\msf p\times(\msf n+\msf m)=
(\msf p\times\msf n)+(\msf p\times\msf m)\,.
\end{equation}
Supplementing this relation with other empirically determining
properties, one infers that the \emph{unary} operationality of
$\oper[-1]n$"=replications \eqref{real'} is \emph{indistinguishable}
from the \emph{binary} operationality on their $\msf n$"=symbols. The
latter, in turn, acquires the multiplicative structure of a
commutative group
\begin{equation}\label{mult}
\msf n\times\msf m=\msf m\times\msf n\,,\qquad
(\msf n\times\msf m)\times\msf p=
\msf n\times(\msf m\times\msf p)\,,\qquad\msf n\times1=
\msf n\,,\qquad\msf n\times\msf n^{\sm1}=1\,,
\end{equation}
and, as for the addition~$+$, it is already binary and commutative
due to properties of~$\cup$ (sect.~\ref{inv}):
\begin{equation}\label{Ax}
\msf n+\msf m=\msf m+\msf n\,,\qquad(\msf n+\msf m)+\msf p=
\msf n+(\msf m+\msf p)\,,\qquad\msf n+0=\msf n\,.
\end{equation}

After having acquired properties \eqref{distr}--\eqref{Ax}---call
them arithmetic, symbols $\{\msf n,\msf m,\ldots\}$ turn into abstract
numbers, although their operator genesis does not go away and is yet
to be involved. This is where a full list of requirements for the
concept of a real number should be added, and which have to do with
ordering~$<$, completeness/""continuality, and their relations with
algebraic rules \eqref{distr}--\eqref{Ax}. We will take that this is
done axiomatically \cite[pp.~35--38]{zorich}, although the algebraic
constituent of this `axiomatics', as we have seen, is not
axiomatical but deducible from empiricism. Multiplication~$\times$,
and also the subsequent ($\odot$)"=multiplication of $\bbC$"=numbers
\eqref{riC}, is a most nontrivial part in deriving the structure
`the arithmetic'.

As an outcome, we reveal an essential asymmetry in genesis of the
standard binary structures~$+$ and~$\times$, and thereby a greater
primacy of \qm"=consideration even over the (seemingly
natural)\label{comment} arithmetic. Indeed, binarity may come only from
operation $\cup$, which is primordially unique and, thereby, is
inherited only to the one natural prototype---addition.
\begin{itemize}
\item Multiplication is not featured in the superposition principle,
 nor does it arise directly as a binary structure. The absence of a
 multiplication symbol in \eqref{s1}--\eqref{s2} is no accident.
\end{itemize}
The multiplication originates in the closedness of replications
$\oper[-1]n\circ\oper[-1]m$, and they are required according to the
\hyperlink{M}{\red\textsf{M}}"=paradigm \eqref{macro}. In effect, any
non"=operatorial way of introducing the $\msf n$"=numbers is not a
self"=evidence for empiricism. An operator nature of the number is
precisely that which gives rise to the second binary operation.
However, the pure axiomatic declaration of arithmetic
\eqref{distr}--\eqref{Ax} will, in one way or another, require a
(reciprocal to \eqref{shema'}) treatment of a number in the context
of `the quantity of what?', while its empirical pre"=image always
appears in the pair $\lceil$`the quantity~$+$ of
some\-thing'$\rceil$. Another way to put it is that,
\begin{itemize}
\item in the foundations of theory, there arises the
 predecessor/""analog of the notion of a physical unit,
\end{itemize}
though the ultimate description is a description in terms of binary
structures \eqref{distr}--\eqref{Ax}. It is carried out by
dropping/""attaching the symbols like $\psi$, which is a quantum
generalization of the physical theory's independence of measurement
units. Certainly, when formalized, the $\oper[-1]n$"=replication and
its binary $\msf n$-twin become universally abstract. For example,
the $\oper[-1]n$"=operator \eqref{real'} may be applied to the
quantum case in which the object $\psi$ has already an internal
structure associated with the presence of
$\statePsi,\statePhi$"=primitives; this changes no the essence of the
matter\label{QMdim}. Another example is when numbers $\msf n$ give birth
to the really observable quantities. See also sect.~\ref{izmer},
Remark~\ref{units}, and additional discussion in sect.~\ref{minus}.

Let us now proceed from the fact that the comprehension/""relation of
the number\footnote{As concerns the philosophical literature, the
issue of numbers was likely discussed \cite{shapiro}, and it would
be appropriate to quote: ``\ldots \ numbers: they can be added to one
another, \emph{perhaps} multiplied by one another, \ldots. But it is
typically obscure what sort of \emph{physical} relation these
mathematical operations could possibly represent'' (T.~Maudlin
\cite[p.~138]{maudlin}; first emphasis ours, second in original).
Cf.~Einstein's remarks concerning ``concepts and propositions'' and
``the series of integers'' on p.~287 in \cite{einstein2}.} and its
operator has been formalized as described above, and `axioms'
\eqref{distr}--\eqref{Ax} have been complemented with the negative
numbers
\begin{equation*}
\msf n+(-\msf n)=0\,,
\end{equation*}
for they have been fully justified in the superposition principle.

\subsection{2-dimensional numbers}\label{C}

A number in and of itself, as a replication operator, may be applied
to any ensemble or, in fact, to anything at all. However, in quantum
case, the `upper' primitives are attached to every `lower'
$\state\alpha$"=event. These primitives, as was noted above, have to
be got rid of. At the same time, the minimal structure, associated
with the homogeneous array $\{\state\alpha_s\cdots\state\alpha_s\}$
as a whole, is a unitary brace $\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf n},
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf m}\}\,\state\alpha_s$ containing two
`upper' primitives $\statePsi$, $\statePhi$. Their order, however,
is arbitrary there. That is to say, given
$(\msf n,\msf m)\,\state\alpha$ there are two quite equal objects
$\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf n},
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf m}\}\,\state\alpha$ and
$\{\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf n},
\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf m}\}\,\state\alpha$ that are subjected
to a replication. Each of them should be in a relationship (see
sect.~\ref{inv}) to any other brace \eqref{nm'}, which is already
apparent in the example of `$1$"=dimensional' versions
$(\msf n,0)\,\state\alpha$ and $(\msf n',0)\,\state\alpha$. For each
pair $\{(\msf n,0)\,\state\alpha,(\msf n',0)\,\state\alpha\}$, there
always exists the number $\msf m$ such that $\oper m\,
(\msf n,0)\,\state\alpha=(\msf n',0)\,\state\alpha$, \ie,
$\msf m\times\msf n=\msf n'$.

As in the classical case \eqref{real}, the sought-for
generalizations of replicators are the transitive automorphisms on
\emph{unitary} $\state\alpha$"=brace \eqref{nmPsi}, but they
\emph{are not} abstract and \emph{not} arbitrary. They are strictly
bound to the declared meaning of a number: $\oper N$"=operation of
creating the copies. Therefore, by virtue of the equal rights of
$\statePsi$ and $\statePhi$, it is imperative to bring the two
1-fold copying acts $\oper N\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf n}\,,
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf m}\}\,\state\alpha$ and $\oper
M\{\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf n}\,,
\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf m}\}\,\state\alpha$ into play, which
differ in the permutation of primitives
$\statePsi\rightleftarrows\statePhi$. This point will determine a
quantum extension of the replication.

As a result, since we have nothing but the `copying' $\oper N$ and
`union' $\Uplus$, the most general transformation of the brace
$\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf n},
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf m}\}\,\state\alpha$ into (any) brace
$\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\vbox to 1.5ex{}\msf n}{}',
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\vbox to 1.5ex{}\msf m}{}'\}\,\state\alpha$,
which is in a quantum"=replication relation with it, is determined by
the rule
\begin{equation}\label{nmU}
\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf n}\,,
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf m}\}\,\state\alpha\quad
\overset{(\widehat{N\!\!\!,M})}{\scalebox{2.5}[1]{$\rightarrowtail$}}
\quad
\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\vbox to 1.5ex{}\msf n}{}',
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\vbox to 1.5ex{}\msf m}{}'\}\,\state\alpha\,,
\qquad
\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\vbox to 1.5ex{}\msf n}{}',
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\vbox to 1.5ex{}\msf m}{}'\}\,\state\alpha=
\oper N\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf n},
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf m}\}\,\state\alpha\;\Uplus\;\oper M
\{\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf n},
\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf m}\}\,\state\alpha\,.
\end{equation}
This is the quantum version of operators
\eqref{real}--\eqref{real'}, and the foregoing ideology of
$\oper N$"=operators and of liberation from the $\statePsi$"=symbols
remains in\OK\ force and entails the following. The numeric
implementation of replicating the unitary brace \eqref{nmPsi}, along
with the $(\msf n,\msf m)$"=representation of itself, is also
determined by a certain pair $(\msf N,\msf M)\in\bbR^2$, \ie, by an
operator symbol $(\widehat{N\!\!,\!M})$.

The aforesaid means that the numeric form $(\msf n,\msf m)\;
\overset{\raisebox{-0.21ex}{$\sss\smash[b]{(\widehat{N\!\!\!,\!M})}$}}
{\scalebox{2.2}[1]{$\ts\rightarrowtail$}}\;(\msf n',\msf m')$ of
transformation \eqref{nmU} is indistinguishable from a composition
of pairs
\begin{equation*}
(\msf N,\msf M)\odot(\msf n,\msf m)=(\msf n',\msf m')\,,
\end{equation*}
where $\odot$ is a designation for the new binary operation. Its
resultant structure is derived from the arithmetic nature
\eqref{mult} of the 1"=dimensional replication \eqref{real} described
above, \ie, from the rules
\begin{equation}\label{NM}
\oper N\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf n},
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf m}\}\,\state\alpha=
\{\msf N{\,\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\mathstrut\times}\,}\msf n,\;
\msf N{\,\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\mathstrut\times}\,} \msf m\}\,
\state\alpha\,,\qquad\oper M\{\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf n},
\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf m}\}\,\state\alpha=
\{\msf M{\,\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\mathstrut\times}\,}
\msf n,\;\msf M{\,\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\mathstrut\times}\,}\msf m\}\,
\state\alpha\,.
\end{equation}
Here, a positivity/""negativity of symbols $(\msf n,\msf m)$ in
\eqref{nmPsi} should also be taken into account. Having regard to
the foregoing, rules \eqref{nmU}--\eqref{NM} generate the Ansatz
\begin{equation}\label{ansatz}
(\msf N,\msf M)\odot(\msf n,\msf m)=(\pm\msf N\,\msf n
\pm\msf M\,\msf m,\;\pm\msf N\,\msf m\pm\msf M\,\msf n)\,,
\end{equation}
wherein all the four signs~$\pm$ are independent of each other, and
the ($\times$)"=multiplication of 1"=dimensional numbers in
\eqref{mult} and \eqref{NM} have been re"=denoted by the habitual
standard $\msf N\,\msf m\DEF\msf N\times\msf m$.

As was the case previously, just emerged binarity for $\odot$ should
inherit associativity, existence of unity $\mathds1$, and of
inversions. Namely, if the $(\msf n,\msf m)$"=pairs are identified
with the notation \eqref{g+} according to the convention
\begin{equation}\label{nma}
(\msf n,\msf m)\FED\frak a\,,
\end{equation}
then the following properties should be declared:
\begin{equation}\label{m+}
(\frak a\odot\frak b)\odot\frak c=\frak a\odot(\frak b\odot\frak c)\,,
\qquad\frak a\odot \mathds1=\frak a\,,\qquad\frak a\odot{\frak a}^{\sm1}=
\mathds1\,.
\end{equation}
From \eqref{nmU}--\eqref{NM} it is not difficult to see that the
combining \eqref{m+} with \eqref{g+} leads to a distributive
coordination of operations $\oplus$ and $\odot$:
\begin{equation}\label{m++}
\frak c\odot(\frak a\oplus\frak b)=
(\frak c\odot\frak a)\oplus(\frak c\odot\frak b)\,.
\end{equation}
However, the direct examination of this property shows that Ansatz
\eqref{ansatz} satisfies it automatically, and examination of an
associativity in \eqref{m+} particularizes \eqref{ansatz} into the
expression
\begin{equation*}
(\msf N,\msf M)\odot(\msf n,\msf m)=
\pm(\msf N\,\msf n\pm\msf M\,\msf m, \msf N\,\msf m+\msf M\,\msf n)\,;
\end{equation*}
now, with two independent signs $\pm$. Moreover, in passing we
reveal the commutativity
\begin{equation}\label{m+++}
\frak a\odot\frak b=\frak b\odot\frak a\,,
\end{equation}
though it was not presumed prior to that. The search for unity
$\mathds1$ and subsequent finding an inversion of the element
$(\msf n,\msf m)$ yield:
\begin{equation*}
\mathds1=(\pm1,0)\,,\qquad(\msf n,\msf m)^{\sm1}=
\Big(\frac{\msf n}{\msf\Delta},
-\frac{\msf m}{\msf\Delta}\Big)\,,\qquad\msf\Delta\DEF
\msf n^2\pm\msf m^2\,.
\end{equation*}
Both the $(\pm)$"=symbols continue to be independent here. The choice
$\msf\Delta=\msf n^2-\msf m^2$ leads to the absence of inversions
$(\msf n,\msf n)^{\sm1}$. This is in conflict with the group
property \eqref{m+} and also gives rise to the unmotivated
exclusivity of the unitary brace $\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf n},
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf n}\}\,\state\alpha$. The case
$\msf\Delta=\msf n^2+\msf m^2$ remains, and it reduces the scheme to
the form
\begin{equation*}
\mathds1=\pm(1,0)\,,\qquad(\msf N,\msf M)\odot(\msf n,\msf m)=
\pm(\msf{N\,n}- \msf{M\,m}, \msf{N\,m}+\msf{M\,n})
\end{equation*}
with a single symbol $\pm$. It is not difficult to see that the
choice of sign~$+$ or $-$ leads to models that are isomorphic in
regard to which of representatives $(+1,0)$ or $(-1,0)$ should be
assigned for the identical replication $\oper[-1]{\mathds I}$. By
virtue of \eqref{unar} it does not matter, and we declare
\begin{equation}\label{riC}
\boxed{\mathds1\DEF(1,0)\,,\qquad(\msf N,\msf M)\odot(\msf n,\msf m)=
(\msf{N\,n}-\msf{M\,m},\msf{N\,m}+\msf{M\,n})}\;.
\end{equation}
This is nothing more nor less than the canonical multiplication of
complex numbers $\msf n+\ri\cdot\msf m=\frak a\in\bbC$, if the
following identifications are performed:
\begin{equation}\label{riC+}
(1,0)\rightleftarrows\mathds1\,,\qquad(0,1)\rightleftarrows\ri\,,\qquad
\{\oplus,\odot\}\rightleftarrows\{+,\cdot\}\,,\qquad(\msf n,\msf m)
\rightleftarrows(\msf n+\ri\cdot\msf m)\,.
\end{equation}

In view of the paramount importance of the $\bbC$"=number field in
\qm\ \cite{benioff}, let us provide additional substantiations to
the rigidity of emergence of this specific numeric structure, \ie,
of the axiom collection \eqref{g+}, \eqref{m+}--\eqref{riC}. Among
other things, the transpositions
$\statePsi\rightleftarrows\statePhi$ used above fit more general
reasoning.

\subsection{Involutions and $\tilde\bbC^*$-algebra}\label{C*}

Apart from a freedom in ordering the primitives
$\statePsi\rightleftarrows\statePhi$ in brace
$\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf n},
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf m}\}\,\state\alpha$, there is one more
arbitrariness: reappointing them
($\statePsi\rightarrowtail\state\Theta$, \ldots) as elements of the set
$\boT$. However, no physics predetermines any of these degrees of
freedom. Say, if other ingoing $\boT$"=elements $\state\Theta$,
$\state\Omega$ were present in \eqref{split'} instead of
$\statePsi$, $\statePhi$, then the $\frak G$"=semigroup theory,
strictly speaking, should be declared the segregated theories
$\frak G_{\sss\state{\!\Psi\!}\,\,\state{\!\Phi\!}}$,
$\frak G_{\sss\state{\!\Theta\!}\,\,\state{\!\Omega\!}}$, \etc. It is
clear that the marking the theories, or they as a family, is a
manifest absurdity, and they should be thus factorized with respect
to all kinds of ways to label them by $\boT$"=primitives. The
liberation from the $\statePsi,\statePhi$"=icons and reconciliation
of the result with pt.~\hyperlink{R+}{$\red\msf R^\textsf{+}$}
(p.~\pageref{R+}) are then performed by the scheme
$\lceil$pri\-mi\-ti\-ve has changed $\rightarrowtail$ a number
character is chang\-ing$\rceil$.

Inasmuch as declaring the $\{\statePsi, \statePhi, \state\Theta,
\ldots\}$ to be ingoing primitives in \eqref{split'} is a replacement
of one to another, any such an appointment boils down to
permutations of no more than \emph{pairs}, with two types
(inner/outer):
\begin{equation}\label{invol}
\oper[-1]{\bo\gimel}_{\sss\Psi\!\Phi}\,\,{:}\quad
(\statePsi,\statePhi)\:\overset{\sss\state{\!\!\Psi\!\!}\,\leftrightarrow\,
\state{\!\!\Phi\!\!}}
{\scalebox{2.3}[1]{$\rightleftarrows$}}\:(\statePhi,\statePsi)\,,\qquad\qquad
\Aleph_{\!\sss\Phi\!\Theta}\,\,{:}\quad
(\statePsi,\statePhi)\:\overset{\sss\state{\!\!\Phi\!\!}\,\leftrightarrow\,
\state{\!\!\Theta\!\!}}
{\scalebox{2.3}[1]{$\rightleftarrows$}}\:(\statePsi,\state\Theta)\,.
\end{equation}
However, it is immediately obvious that these reappointments change
nothing in the $\cup$"=relationships between \eqref{split'} and are
defined by the structural relations
$\pow{\oper[-1]{\bo\gimel}}{\sss\Psi\!\Phi}{2}=\oper[-1]{\mathds I}$,
$\pow{\Aleph}{\!\sss\Phi\!\Theta}2=\oper[-1]{\mathds I}$. Then the
need to indicate the primitives themselves, as required, is
eliminated, and their symbols may be thrown away, if semigroup
$\frak G$ is correctly furnished with the two abstract involutions
$\oper[-1]{\bo\gimel}$ and $\Aleph$. The $\frak G$ itself, of
course, possesses also involution \eqref{unar} that turns it into
the group \itsf{H}, but this involution has already had a numeric
representation \eqref{nmPsi} by signs $\pm$. To be precise, it
suffices to identify here the term `numeric' with the group
arithmetic of the $\oplus$"=addition \eqref{g+} coming from the
superposition principle realized on pairs
\eqref{oplus}--\eqref{nmPsi}. Therefore the operators' actions
\eqref{invol} should be carried over onto objects defined in
precisely this manner; nothing more needs to be assumed.

Operator $\oper[-1]{\bo\gimel}_{\sss\Psi\!\Phi}$ is immediately
translated into a numeric form independently of the property that
the objects $\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf n},
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf m}\}\,\state\alpha$ form a (semi)group.
In fact, since the swap $\statePsi\rightleftarrows\statePhi$ in the
unordered pair
\begin{equation*}
\oper[-1]{\bo\gimel}_{\sss\Psi\!\Phi}:\qquad
\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf n},
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf m}\}\rightarrowtail
\{\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf n},\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf m}\}
=\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf m},
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf n}\}\qquad\cdots
\end{equation*}
(the $\state\alpha$"=label is dropped here as superfluous) is
indistinguishable from permutation of numbers
$\msf n\rightleftarrows\msf m$, the symbols $\statePsi$ and
$\statePhi$ may be thrown away, organizing the numbers themselves
into the ordered pairs
\begin{equation*}
\cdots\quad\hence\quad(\msf n,\msf m)
\overset{\oper{\scs\bo\gimel}}{\rightarrowtail}(\msf m,\msf n)\,.
\end{equation*}
When required, the $\state\alpha$"=symbol returns hereinafter.

Let us now proceed to the outer involution
$\statePhi\rightleftarrows\state\Theta$ in \eqref{invol}:
\begin{equation*}
\Aleph_{\sss\Phi\!\Theta}:\qquad\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf n},
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf m}\}\rightarrowtail
\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf n},
\overset{\sss\state\Theta}{\msf m}\}\,.
\end{equation*}
It is indifferent to the (first) $\statePsi$"=element of the pair,
and, extracting it by the rule
\begin{equation*}
\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf n},\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf m}\}=
\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\makebox[0mm]{\phantom0}\msf n},
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{0}\}
\Uplus
\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{0},\overset{\sss\statePhi}
{\makebox[0mm]{\phantom0}\msf m}\}\,,
\end{equation*}
the question boils down to finding a representation to the
transformations
\begin{equation*}
\big(\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\makebox[0mm]{\phantom0}\msf n},
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{0}\} \Uplus
\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{0},\overset{\sss\statePhi}
{\makebox[0mm]{\phantom0}\msf m}\}\big)\;
\rightarrowtail\;\big(\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}
{\makebox[0mm]{\phantom0}\msf n}{}',\overset{\sss\statePhi}{0}\}
\Uplus \{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{0},\overset{\sss\state\Theta}
{\makebox[0mm]{\phantom0}\msf m}{}'\}\big)\qquad
(\overset{?}{\vbox to1.5ex{}\msf n}{}',
\overset{?}{\vbox to1.5ex{}\msf m}{}')\,.
\end{equation*}
The component $\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}
{\makebox[0mm]{\phantom0}\msf n},\overset{\sss\statePhi}{0}\}$ must
go into itself, since the symbol $\statePsi$ attached to it has not
changed. It means that $\msf n'=\msf n$, and one is left\OK\ with
the task
\begin{equation*}
\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{0},
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\makebox[0mm]{\phantom0}\msf m}\}\;
\overset{?}{\rightleftarrows} \{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{0},
\overset{\sss\state\Theta} {\makebox[0mm]{\phantom0}\msf m}{}'\}\,.
\end{equation*}
However, operation $\Aleph_{\sss\Phi\!\Theta}$ recognizes only the
primitive's symbols rather than their numbers. That is, replications
$\oper[-1]m\,\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{0},
\pm\overset{\sss\statePhi}{1}\}= \{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{0},
\pm\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\makebox[0mm]{\phantom0}\msf m}\}$ do
formally commute with $\Aleph_{\sss\Phi\!\Theta}$. Hence, omitting
the letters $\{\statePsi,\statePhi,\state\Theta\}$, it will suffice
to look for the representation of $\Aleph$ by numeric pairs
$(0,\pm\msf m)$ factorized with respect to replications
$\oper[-1]m$, \ie, by the set $\{(0,1), (0,-1)\}$. It, for its part,
remains to be transformed into itself, and the replication operators
$\oper[-1]n$, $\oper[-1]m$ will recreate the generic case. The
identical transformation $(0,\pm1)\rightarrowtail(0,\pm1)$ is ruled
out due to $\Aleph_{\sss\Phi\!\Theta}\ne\oper[-1]{\mathds I}$;
therefore,
$(0,\pm1)\overset{\raisebox{-0.21ex}{$\sss\smash[b]%
{\widehat{\bo\aleph}}$}}{\rightarrowtail}(0,\mp1)$. Restoring all
the symbols that were dropped, effect of $\Aleph$ reduces to the
sign change for the 2-nd element of the coordinate pair:
\begin{equation}\label{aleph}
(\msf n,\msf m)\overset{\widehat{\bo\aleph}}{\rightarrowtail}
(\msf n,-\msf m)\,.
\end{equation}

There is no need to change sign for the 1-st element, as this change
is the operator $-\oper[-1]{\mathds I}\circ\Aleph$. Furthermore, one
observes that the already existing group inversion
$-\oper[-1]{\mathds I}$ coincides with composition
\begin{equation}\label{ri}
(\Aleph\circ\oper[-1]{\bo\gimel})^2=-\oper[-1]{\mathds I}\,,
\end{equation}
and we may even `forget' about it, leaving the equipment
\begin{equation}\label{base}
\{\oplus,\oper[-1]{\mathds
I},\oper[-1]m,\Aleph,\oper[-1]{\bo\gimel}\}
\end{equation}
of semigroup $\frak G$ as an irreducible set of mathematical
structures over~it.

In this connection yet another---more formal---motivation of the
passage $\lceil$se\-mi\-group $\rightarrowtail$ group$\rceil$, and
thus of the superposition principle, does arise. In fact, the
derivation of $\Aleph$ above engaged the inversion \eqref{unar}, but
reappointment of primitives $\statePhi\rightleftarrows\state\Theta$
in \eqref{invol} is a fully independent act. Therefore if we forget
about `$(-)$"=copies of the positive pairs' $(0,\msf m)$, then the
involutory nature of automorphism $\Aleph_{\sss\Phi\!\Theta}$ would
still reproduce the semigroup $\frak G$ in numbers by `duplication'
$\msf m\rightarrowtail\pm\msf m$, \ie, create the negative pairs
$(0,-\msf m)$, thus turning $\frak G$ into a group \itsf{H}. An
analogous reasoning on the symbol `$-$' could be cited even earlier,
when the $\bbC$"=field was being derived.

Now, remembering the above"=described passage to the binarity of
$\odot$"=multiplication on the $(\msf n,\msf m)$"=pairs, we arrive at
the problem of matching it with structures~\eqref{base}. Clearly,
one needs only to ascertain the functionality of operators
$\oper[-1]{\bo\gimel}$ and $\Aleph$ that were not available yet.
Relation \eqref{ri} immediately gives us the correspondence
$\Aleph\circ\oper[-1]{\bo\gimel}\rightleftarrows\ri$, since
$\ri^2=-1$. Hence, one of these operators, say
$\oper[-1]{\bo\gimel}$, manifests\OK\ itself in the imaginary unit
$\ri$. Origin of this operator---permutation
$\oper[-1]{\bo\gimel}_{\sss\Psi\!\Phi}$ in \eqref{invol}---is the
very same permutation $\statePsi\rightleftarrows\statePhi$ that
generated the $\ri$"=object in algebra \eqref{riC}--\eqref{riC+}. The
second operator, \ie, \eqref{aleph}, as is directly seen, is also
not related to the binary $\oplus$ and $\odot$ but determines the
change $\ri\rightarrowtail -\ri$. This means that the
\qm"=consideration does not just lead to the field $\bbC$ but to a
division $\tilde \bbC^*$"=algebra, which is equipped with the two
\emph{non"=binary} operations
\begin{equation*}
\frak a\overset{\raisebox{-0.21ex}{$\sss\smash[b]%
{\widehat{\bo\aleph}}$}} {\rightarrowtail}\frak a^*\,,\qquad
\frak a\overset{\raisebox{-0.21ex}{$\sss\smash[b]%
{\widehat{\bo\gimel}}$}} {\rightarrowtail}\tilde {\frak a}\,.
\end{equation*}
Informally, it defines \emph{all the basic} actions on `complex
quantities' and thereby determines a \qm"=extension/""generalization of
the intuitive (arithmetical) manipulations with the habitual real
quantities \eqref{shema'}--\eqref{Ax}. Consequently, the four binary
arithmetical operations---addition/""sub\-traction and
multiplication/""division---should be supplemented with the two unary
ones: conjugation $\Aleph$ and swap $\oper[-1]{\bo\gimel}$.

\begin{comment}
A curious observation for the formal complex"=number `mathematics' is
in place. None of these operators boils down to involution
$-\oper[-1]{\mathds I}$. We mean that each of the pairs
$(\Aleph,-\oper[-1]{\mathds I})$ or
$(\oper[-1]{\bo\gimel},-\oper[-1]{\mathds I})$ is expressible
through $(\oper[-1]{\bo\gimel},\Aleph)$, and not the reverse. To put
it plainly, the self"=suggested going\look[move] from the natural
sign change (\ie, $-\oper[-2]{1}$ over $\bbR$) to the inversion of
the 2"=dimensional $\oplus$"=addition (\ie, $-\oper[-1]{\mathds I}$
over $\bbC$) deprives the involution $-\oper[-1]{\mathds I}$ of its
primary character, as it has taken in the 1"=dimensional domain
$\bbR$. Furthermore, the 2-nd operation $\oper[-1]{\bo\gimel}$ is,
in a sense, more `primitive' even than the complex conjugation
$\Aleph$, as the operation has to do with a formal pair
$(\msf n,\msf m)$---merely transposes it---and does not invoke an
arithmetic action, as does $\Aleph$ when changing the sign
$\msf m\mapsto-\msf m$ in~\eqref{aleph}. Relationship between the
operators is by the binary multiplication:
$\tilde{\frak a}=\ri\odot\frak a^*$. By virtue of this relation it
makes no odds which one of these unary operators is left for the
$\bbC$"=algebra.

\end{comment}

We note---and this is important \cite{brezhnev}---that the
observational statistics are unchanged upon both operations
$\oper[-1]{\bo\gimel}$,~$\Aleph$.

\subsection{Naturalness of $\bbC$-numbers}\label{naturalC}

Thus the $\boT$"=set primitives have been entirely banished from the
theory, with the exception of the eigen"=state
$\state\alpha_s$"=markers, which are needed only for
distinguishability (sect.~\ref{S}) of $\scr A$"=observations. These
markers may be interchanged, but permutability
$\state\alpha_j\rightleftarrows\state\alpha_k$ is already reflected
by the superposition's commutativity. Taking now account of the fact
that reassigning the $\state\alpha$"=labels does not touch on the
concept of the number, one infers: the invariance attained above is
exhaustive. As a result, we draw the following conclusion.
\begin{itemize}
\item The coordinate representatives $\{\frak a, \frak b, \frak c,
 \ldots\}$ of states and superpositions thereof \eqref{s1} form the
 complex number field $\tilde\bbC^*$ equipped with the structures of
 conjugation and of swap:
 \begin{equation}\label{inv2}
 (\msf n+\ri\,\msf m)\overset{\raisebox{-0.21ex}{$\scs\smash*$}}
 \mapsto(\msf n-\ri\,\msf m)\,,\qquad (\msf n+\ri\,\msf m)\mathbin
 {\Larger[2]{\tilde{\Smaller[3]\mapsto}}}
 (\msf m+\ri\,\msf n)\,.
 \end{equation}
 Statistical weights $\nu_s$ in object \eqref{set} are invariant
 with respect to both the involutions
 $\nu_j(\frak a^*)=\nu_j(\frak a)= \nu_j(\tilde{\frak a})$ for each
 component $\frak a_s$ independently.
\end{itemize}
What is more, the commentary on the primacy of \qm\ over the
abstract arithmetic (see p.~\pageref{comment}) has a logical
continuation.
\begin{itemize}
\item Quantum"=theoretic description invokes no $\bbC$"=numbers; it
 creates them together with the $\tilde\bbC^*$"=algebra.
\end{itemize}
This fact is remarkable in its own right because the `2"=dimensional'
numbers arise at the lowest empirical level, not from the need for
solving any mathematical problems. Mathematics is still lacking.
Therefore pt.~\hyperlink{R+}{$\ds\msf R^\textsf{+}$} (p.~\pageref{R+})
could have even been weakened by replacing `homomorphism onto
numbers', roughly, with the `homomorphism onto continuum'. Our
minimal points of departure are replications and the
`ingoing/""outgoing' structure of brace \eqref{split'}. The imaginary
part of the complex number---as a supplement to the real one---comes
in essence from the left hand side of the conception
$\statePsi\goto\state\alpha$. Neither does theory depend on the
meanings that will be later attached to the physical
concepts---observables, measurement, spectra, means, \etc---to their
interpretations or rigorous definitions. At the same time, the
interferential `effects of subtraction and of zeroes' are
intrinsically present in the very foundation of the construct.

Let us add, in conclusion, two more formal vindications of rigidity
of emerging the $\bbC$"=structure. In doing so, one assumes that we
have already had the $\bbR$"=numbers.

Unitary brace contain pairs of the form
$\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\makebox[0mm]{\phantom0}\msf n},
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{0}\}$. The binary operations
$\{\oplus,\odot\}$ on their numeric representatives $(\msf n,0)$ are
closed and, as easily seen, form a commutative field, which is
isomorphic to $\bbR$. It is a subset of the generic pair set
$(\msf n,\msf m)$. From the operator nature of $\odot$ it follows
that these pairs form a certain distributive ring with general"=group
properties \eqref{m+}--\eqref{m++}. The presence of the field $\bbR$
contained in it tells us that these pairs can be realized by the
elements $\msf n+\msf m\,x$ of, at most, associative algebra $A$ over
$\bbR$. Here, $\msf n,\msf m\in\bbR$, $x$ is a generator of any
ring's element beyond $\bbR$, and the habitual~$+$ replaces the sign
$\oplus$. Multiplication of two such elements
\begin{Align*}
(\msf{n+m}\,x)\odot(\msf{n'+m'}\,x)&=
\msf{n\,n'+(m\,n'+n\,m')}\,x+\msf{m\,m'}\,x^2=\cdots
\intertext{immediately shows that result does not depend on order of
factors, \ie,}
\cdots&=(\msf{n'+m'}\,x)\odot(\msf{n+m}\,x)\,,
\end{Align*}
due to permutability of $\{\msf{n,m,n',m'}\}$ between each other and
of any $x$ with itself. This is a direct consequence of
2"=dimensionality of the algebra $A$; it must be commutative.
Invoking now the well-known Frobenius theorem on associative and
commutative structures containing the field $\bbR$ \cite{vander}, we
arrive once again at a multiplication of the form~\eqref{riC}.

\subsubsection{Topologies on numbers}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{\qquad\qquad Topologies on numbers}

Yet another reasoning about exclusivity of $\bbC$"=numbers follows
from matching the topological and algebraic properties of the
general numeric systems \cite[sect.~27]{pontr}. The case in hand is
the uniqueness and non"=arbitrariness in emergence of the topological
field $\bbC$; Pontryagin (1932). In our case, we have two
continuums---numeric symbols $\msf n$ and $\msf m$, each of which,
by the very method of constructing the $\obj{\state\Xi}$"=objects
\eqref{min}, is equipped only with the natural ordering $<$. Since
we have no any more math"=structures yet, the topology, continuity,
and limits on each of the continuums can already be introduced with
respect to this relation. For one example, there is no need to
introduce a topology by a~priori creating the arithmetic operation
of multiplication/""divisibility of rationals (and a concept of the
prime integer), as it is done in the $p$-adic approaches to \qm\
\cite{hren2, vladimirov, hren0}. The `non"=naturalness' of
multiplication as compared with addition was already noted above.
Besides, in the $p$-adic versions for a numeric domain, the
topologically and physically required matching between the natural
ordering, connection, and continuity \cite[Ch.~4]{pontr} is
destroyed, and the approaches themselves stipulate the existence of
the \emph{observations} numbers with a comprehensive arithmetic.
%(неприводимость топологии)
%\footnote{Она строго необходимо в
%дальнейшем, если теория совмещается с бесконечными спектрами
%наблюдаемых и средних значений по ним.}
At the same time, questions about `structure' of the physical
$x$"=space at Planck's scale\footnote{D.~Mermin: ``when I hear that
spacetime becomes a foam at the Planck scale, I don't reach for my
gun''~\cite{mermin}.} and about measurements by rationals (see
motivation in \cite{vladimirov, hren2}) are not arising yet, because
we are not relying on physical conceptions and are not yet
introducing these notions as numerical. The $x$"=space itself is as
yet absent. From the low"=level empiricism standpoint, any objects,
apart from the $\bbR^2$"=continuality and frequencies $\nu$, require
call for independent axioms. In turn, the primary nature of the
$\bbR$"=continuality itself follows directly from the boolean
$2^\boT$ (p.~\pageref{bulean}) and $\Sigma$"=postulate of infinity.

\subsection{Linear vector space}

Once replication $(\widehat{N\!\!,M})$ of brace
$\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf n},
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf m}\}\,\state\alpha$ has acquired a
binary character
\begin{equation}\label{pq-}
(\widehat{N\!\!,M})\big(\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf n},
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf m}\}\,\state\alpha\,\big)
\quad\hhence\quad\big((\msf N,\msf M)\odot(\msf n,\msf m)\big)
\bet\alpha=\frak a\,\bet\alpha\,,
\end{equation}
the difference between `what is replicated' and `how many times'
disappears. A symbol $\bet\alpha$ of the eigen"=state has been
attached to the abstract $\bbC$"=number $\frak a$. Construing this
point as a quantum analog of re"=choosing (liberation of) the
measurement units (p.~\pageref{QMdim}), we obtain that the two
formal states $\frak a\,\bet\alpha$ and $\frak b\,\bet\alpha$ are
always connected by a certain number operator~$\oper[-1]{\frak p}$:
\begin{equation*}
\frak b\,\bet\alpha=\oper[-1]{\frak p}\,\big(\frak a\,
\bet\alpha\big)\,,\qquad\oper[-1]{\frak p}\rightleftarrows\frak b\odot
\frak a^{\sm1}\,.
%= (\frak b\odot\frak a^{\sm1})\big(\frak a\,
%\bet\alpha\big)=(\frak b\odot\frak a^{\sm1}\odot\frak a)
%\big(\mathds1\,\bet\alpha\big)=\frak b\big(\mathds1\, \bet\alpha\big)\,
\end{equation*}

Manipulating the numbers becomes independent of symbols
$\bet\alpha$. The way to formalize this is to think of generic
states $\frak a\,\bet\Psi\in\itsf{H}$ as the `solid characters'
\begin{equation}\label{finalHomo}
\frak a\,\bet\Psi\rightarrowtail\ket\Xi\in\bbH\,,
\end{equation}
\ie, as the $\ket\Xi$"=elements of a new set $\bbH$, which is
equipped with the $\oper[-1]{\frak p}$"=replication images
represented by the $\frak p$"=family ($\frak p\in\bbC$) of maps
\begin{equation}\label{finalHomo+}
\bbC\Times\bbH\;\overset{\ds\bo\cdot}\mapsto\;\bbH:\qquad
\frak p\bo\cdot\ket\Xi=\ketPhi\in\bbH\,,
\end{equation}
and which is obliged to inherit the structure \eqref{pq-}. This
inheritance says that coordination of $\odot$"=multiplication in
\eqref{pq-} with the replication's $\frak p$"=realization is
performed by a new operation~$\bo\cdot$ of the unary kind on $\bbH$,
\ie, \eqref{finalHomo+}, which should be subordinated to the rule
\begin{equation}\label{pq}
\frak p\bo\cdot\big(\frak a\bo\cdot\ketPsi\big)=
(\frak p\odot\frak a)\bo\cdot\ketPsi\,\qquad(\frak p,\frak a\in\bbC\,,\quad
\ketPsi\in\bbH)\,.
\end{equation}
Due to this connection between operations $\odot$ and~$\bo\cdot$, it
would be logical to refer to the latter as multiplication as well.
An analogous rule had already occurred in relationship \eqref{s2}
between the $\oplus$"=number $\bbC$"=structure and the $(\+)$"=group
superposition, \ie, when the multiplicative structures
$\{\odot,\bo\cdot\}$ were not available yet.

Among replication operators $\oper[-1]{\frak p}$, there exists an
identical transformation
\begin{equation*}
\oper[-1]{\frak p}=\oper[-1]{\mathds I}:\qquad\frak a\,\bet\Psi
\overset{\skew{1}\widehat{\mathds
I}}{\rightarrowtail}\frak a\,\bet\Psi\,,
\end{equation*}
to which a symbol of the numeric unity $\frak p=\mathds1$
corresponds. In accordance with
\eqref{finalHomo}--\eqref{finalHomo+}, there hence follows the rule
\begin{equation*}
\mathds1\bo\cdot\ket\Xi=\ket\Xi\,,\qquad
\forall\,\,\ket\Xi\in\bbH\,.
\end{equation*}

It is clear that the ($\bo\cdot$)"=multiplication needs to be agreed
with the $\uplus$"=union. Let us make use of the fact that the object
of (quantum) replication may be not only the unitary brace
$\{\overset{\sss\statePsi}{\msf n},
\overset{\sss\statePhi}{\msf m}\}\,\state\alpha$, which is equivalent
to the eigen"=element $\frak a\,\bet\alpha$, but a $(\Uplus)$"=sum of
the like objects and, in general, any constituents of quantum
ensembles (see p.~\pageref{shema'}). Therefore the
$\oper[-1]{\frak p}$"=replication
\begin{equation}\label{cab}
\oper[-1]{\frak p}\,\big(\frak a\,\bet\alpha\+\frak b\,\bet\beta\big)=
\cdots
\end{equation}
is known to have its twin-sum
\begin{equation}\label{cab'}
\cdots=\frak a'\,\bet\alpha\+\frak b'\,\bet\beta=\cdots
\end{equation}
with certain coefficients $\frak a'$, $\frak b'$. Let us, for the
moment, give back \eqref{cab} to the initial language of
operators/brace according to the scheme
\begin{equation}\label{pab}
(\underbrace{\widehat{N,M}}_{\ts\frak p\mathstrut})\,,\qquad
\{\underbrace{\overset{\sss\statePsi}
{\vbox to1.4ex{}\msf n}\cramp',\overset{\sss\statePhi}
{\vbox to1.4ex{}\msf m}\cramp'}_{\ts\frak a\mathstrut}\}\,\state\alpha\Uplus
\{\underbrace{\overset{\sss\statePsi}
{\vbox to1.4ex{}\msf n}\cramp{''},\overset{\sss\statePhi}
{\vbox to1.4ex{}\msf m}{}''}_{\ts\frak b\mathstrut}\}\,\state\beta\,.
\end{equation}
Take also into account a pre"=image of operation~$\Uplus$ on objects
\eqref{cab}, \ie,~$\+$. Then, \eqref{pab} and content of
sects.~\ref{C}--\ref{C*} shows certainly that expression
\eqref{cab'} must be of the form
\begin{equation*}
\cdots=(\frak p\odot\frak a)\,\bet\alpha\+
(\frak p\odot\frak b)\,\bet\beta=\cdots\,.
\end{equation*}
Reconverting, by \eqref{pq}, expressions like
$(\frak p\odot\frak a)\,\bet\alpha$ into the operatorial
$\oper[-1]{\frak p}(\frak a\,\bet\alpha)$, we complete the ellipsis
\begin{equation*}
\cdots=\oper[-1]{\frak p}\,\big(\frak a\,\bet\alpha\big)\+
\oper[-1]{\frak p}\,\big(\frak b\,\bet\beta\big)\,.
\end{equation*}
Passing now to the $\frak p$"=number and to the $\ket\Xi$"=objects
\eqref{finalHomo}, \ie, replacing
$\frak a\,\bet\alpha\rightarrowtail\ketPsi$,
$\frak b\,\bet\beta\rightarrowtail\ketPhi$, one derives a linearity
of operation~$\bo\cdot$ when acting on a sum:
\begin{equation*}
\frak p\bo\cdot\big(\ketPsi\h+\ketPhi\big)=
\frak p\bo\cdot\ketPsi\h+ \frak p\bo\cdot\ketPhi\,.
\end{equation*}
Here, the \itsf{H}"=addition $\+$ has been carried over to the group
$\bbH$ as a new symbol~$\h+$. This is nothing but a distributive
coordination of the ($\bo\cdot$)"=multiplication with the group
addition~$\h+$.

In a similar way---through a number operator, one establishes yet
another relation $\frak a\bo\cdot\ket\Xi\h+ \frak b\bo\cdot\ket\Xi=
(\frak a\oplus\frak b)\bo\cdot\ket\Xi$ between $\bo\cdot$ and~$\h+$;
its origin is equivalent to \eqref{s2}. From the constructs above,
it is not difficult to see that we have examined all the
possibilities of replicating the superpositions \eqref{s1} or their
constituents by arbitrary $\bbC$"=numbers, which is why we have
exhausted all the compatibility rules that stem from the two
fundamental operations---replication and union~($\+$).

Thus, having considered the passage
\eqref{finalHomo}--\eqref{finalHomo+} as a final homomorphism of the
\itsf{H}"=group elements $\frak a\,\bet\Psi$ onto the objects
$\ket\Xi\in\bbH$, \ie, adjusting the previous concept of a
state---\texttt{DataSource} (p.~\pageref{o+}), we infer the following.
\begin{itemize}
\item {The minimal and mathematically invariant bearer of the
 observation's empiricism is an abstract space $\bbH$ of states
 $\ketPsi$ of the system $\cal S$}. The structural properties
\begin{Align}
\bbH&\DEF\big\{\ketPsi\,,\ketPhi\,,\ldots\big\}\,\quad&
&\text{(commutative group under operation $\h+$)},\label{axiom1}\\
\bbC&\DEF\{\frak a\,,\frak b\,,\ldots\}\,\quad& &\text{(field of complex
numbers: \eqref{g+},
\eqref{nma}--\eqref{riC})}\,,\notag\\
&\phantom{{}\DEF{}}\frak a\bo\cdot\ketPsi\in\bbH\,\quad&&
\text{(closedness under external operation $\bo\cdot$)}\,,\label{axiom2}
\end{Align}
\begin{gather}
\begin{aligned}
\frak a\bo\cdot\big(\frak b\bo\cdot\ketPsi\big)&=
(\frak a\odot\frak b)\bo\cdot\ketPsi\,,\quad&
\frak a\bo\cdot\ketPsi\h+\frak b\bo\cdot\ketPsi&=
(\frak a\oplus\frak b)\bo\cdot\ketPsi\,,\\
\mathds1\bo\cdot\ketPsi&=\ketPsi\,,&
\frak a\bo\cdot\big(\ketPsi\h+\ketPhi\big)&=\frak a\bo\cdot\ketPsi\h+
\frak a\bo\cdot\ketPhi
\end{aligned}\label{axiom3}
\end{gather}
of the space coincide with axioms of a linear vector space (\lvs)
over the field~$\bbC$.
\end{itemize}
This `axiom list' should be complemented with a declaration of the
global number \texttt{D} value \eqref{D} established above. Stated in a
nutshell, the nature of the quantum state space is twofold: group
superposition \eqref{s1} and operator nature of the
`$\frak a$"=numbering' the elements of the group, \ie, it admits
scalars as operators. Relations \eqref{axiom3} describe rules of
`interactions' between all the objects. It is known that such
formations, while being implemented by a binary algebra of numbers,
turn into the vector spaces and modules \cite[Ch.~5]{kurosh},
\cite[sects.~\textbf{I}(7.1--2), \textbf{II}(13.4)]{vander}. Concerning
consistency of these rules---say, of numeric distributivity
\eqref{m++}---with relations \eqref{axiom3}, see the
work~\cite{rigby}.

\begin{comment}
A certain oddity is in place. \qm"=empiricism is such that the
standard definition of \lvs\ by the all-too"=familiar axioms
\eqref{axiom1}--\eqref{axiom3} is more \emph{non}physical by its
nature than the `generalistic' abstraction of a group with operator
automorphisms of the group \itsf{H}"=structure itself
\cite[sect.~\textbf{I}(4.2)]{burbaki}, \cite{kurosh}. A point like this
might be expected, though. This is because, as noted in
sect.~\ref{super}, meaning of all of tokens in \eqref{1} and their
origin are entirely unknown, and linearity of \qm\ is radically
different from other `linearities' in physics.
\end{comment}

\subsection{Bases, countability, and infinities}%\label{bases}

From a ban on transitions $\state\alpha_s\GOTO[2]{}\state\alpha_n$
under $s\ne n$ it follows that unitary $\state\alpha_s$"=brace
\eqref{min} correspond to vectors $\frak a_s\bo\cdot\ket{\alpha_s}$
that are linearly inexpressible through each other. Aside from the
general ensemble brace \eqref{split'}, no other elements exist, and
all of them are in one-to-one correspondence with the vector
representations $\frak a_1\bo\cdot\ket{\alpha_1}\h+\frak a_2\bo\cdot
\ket{\alpha_2}\h+\cdots$. Each such vector has a statistical
pre"=image \eqref{split'}, and vice versa; there are no gaps. This
means that the system of vectors
$\{\ket{\alpha_1},\ket{\alpha_2},\ldots\}$ forms a basis of $\bbH$ as
the basis of \lvs---\emph{basis of an observable $\scr A$, or
$\scr A$"=basis}---and the number of symbols $\ket{\alpha_s}$ is its
dimension: $\dim\bbH=\texttt{D}$. The $\texttt{D}=\infty$ case, just like
anything associated with infinity, can not be formalized without
topology, and its presence is presumed, but discussion is dropped.
We just remark that even earlier, when arising the 2"=dimensional
continuum, we have silently assumed the $(\bbR\Times\bbR)$"=product
topology on it. This supposition is natural, inasmuch as it does not
involve additional constructions/""requirements. Thus if properties
\eqref{axiom1}--\eqref{axiom3} are directly accepted to be
empirical, then the mathematical rigors augment them axiomatically
on the outside, because one constructs the mathematical theory.

The micro"=transition $\TRANS[2]{\sss\scr A}$ in sect.~\ref{S}---the
click---is a solitary entity. This means that the number of the
eigen $\state\alpha_s$"=primitives for an actual instrument may be
either finite or discretely unbounded. We base upon the fact that
continual formations is a product of mathematics rather than
empiricism; see also \cite[p.~35]{ludwig5}. The $\boT$-set, as an
example, is also non"=continual, but that premise may even be given
up, because only a discrete portion of this set is present at
arguments (transitions $\GOTO{\sss\scr A}$). Notice incidentally
that continuum does not feature in the \zf"=axioms \cite{kurat} but
is also created, just as ``an infinity is actually not given to us at
all, but is \ldots\ extrapolated through an intellectual process.''
(Hilbert--Bernays \cite[p.~55]{kleene}). One obtains a countability
of the $\scr A$"=basis. Hence follows a completeness of $\bbH$ and
countability of dimension \eqref{D}, as of numeric \lvs"=invariant:
\begin{equation}\label{D'}
\texttt{D}=2,3,\ldots,\aleph_0\qquad( = \dim\bbH)\,.
\end{equation}

Finally, let us mention the following. The concept of a basis is a
term that in no way is present in the (abstract) axiomatics of \lvs.
Empirically, in turn, the $\bbH$"=space is arising entirely and
ab~initio in all kinds of linear combinations over $\ket{\alpha_j}$;
\ie, through $\scr A$"=bases. The conforming such a property and the
formal existence of a basis is given by a nontrivial math theorem
invoking the axiom of choice \cite[sect.~\textbf{II}(7.1)]{burbaki}.

\subsection{The theorem}%\label{theorem}

The states $\ketPsi$ and sums thereof, at the moment, form a formal
family of different elements. Recall that symbols
$\{\approx,\not\approx\}$ in pt.~\hyperlink{R}{\red\textsf{R}}, as from
the end of sect.~\ref{SS}, have been replaced with the standard ones
$\{=,\ne\}$. The physical aspects of $\SM$ were being left aside so
far, and, for example, $\ketPsi$ and $\frak c\bo\cdot\ketPsi$ were
the different vectors of the $\bbH$"=space. However,
\begin{itemize}
\item empiricism (deals with and) yields \emph{not states} and
 superpositions thereof \emph{but $\ket{\alpha}$"=representations}.
\end{itemize}
It is these representations that carry information about statistics
$(\nu_1,\nu_2,\ldots)$ through coefficients $\frak a_j$. The
replicative character of $\frak c$"=multipliers and
$\Sigma$"=postulate entail however that the two vectors
$\mathds1\bo\cdot\ketPsi$ and $\frak c\bo\cdot\ketPsi$ should
correspond to the one and the same statistics
$\nu_{\!\!\sss\scr D}=(1,0,\ldots)=\tilde\nu_{\!\!\sss\scr D}$ under an
observation $\scr D$ with the eigen collection
$\{\mathds1\,\bet\Psi,\ldots\}$. Let us write the equalities
\begin{equation}\label{tmpD}
\begin{array}{rcccl}
\nu_{\!\!\sss\scr D}&\twoheadleftarrow\quad
\underbrace{\mathds1\bo\cdot\ketPsi}&=&
\underbrace{\frak a_1\bo\cdot\ket{\alpha_1}\h+\frak a_2\bo\cdot
\ket{\alpha_2}\h+\cdots}&\twoheadrightarrow\quad\nu_{\!\!\sss\scr A}\,,\\
&\scs\text{observation $\scr D$}&&\scs\text{observation $\scr A$}\\
%
\tilde\nu_{\!\!\sss\scr D}&\twoheadleftarrow\quad
\overbrace{\frak c\bo\cdot\ketPsi}&=&
\overbrace{\frak c\bo\cdot\big(\frak a_1\bo\cdot\ket{\alpha_1}
\h+\frak a_2\bo\cdot\ket{\alpha_2}\h+\cdots\big)}
&\twoheadrightarrow\quad\tilde\nu_{\!\!\sss\scr A}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
and look at them in the following order: the first line---from right
to left, and the second---in the reverse direction. Their right hand
sides are the carriers of some statistics $\nu_{\!\!\sss\scr A}$ and
$\tilde\nu_{\!\!\sss\scr A}$. The frequencies
$\nu_{\!\!\sss\scr A}=(\nu_1,\nu_2,\ldots)$ come from the numeric set
$(\frak a_1,\frak a_2,\ldots)$ under the same environments $\SM$ that
give rise to the statistics $\nu_{\!\!\sss\scr D}$. But it is also
generated by the representative $\frak c\bo\cdot\ketPsi$, which is
associated with the same $\SM$; hence,
$\tilde\nu_{\!\!\sss\scr D}=\nu_{\!\!\sss\scr D}$. By virtue of the
second equal sign in \eqref{tmpD}, the same $\SM$ are associated
with the second $\scr A$"=collection $(\frak c\odot\frak a_1,
\frak c\odot\frak a_2,\ldots)$. Therefore the frequencies
$\tilde\nu_{\!\!\sss\scr A}$ that emanate from it have to be identical
to those emanating from the first collection
$(\frak a_1,\frak a_2,\ldots)$. That is to say
$\tilde\nu_{\!\!\sss\scr A}=\nu_{\!\!\sss\scr A}$, and the scale
dilatations $\ketPsi\rightarrowtail\frak c\bo\cdot\ketPsi$ are not
recognized by any $\scr A$"=instruments. A more concise reasoning is
that the quantum replication $\frak c=\msf n+\ri\,\msf m$ may be
viewed as the 1"=dimensional replications
$\oper[-1]n\,(\frak a\bet\alpha)$,
$\oper[-1]{\text\i}\,\,(\frak a\bet\alpha)$ of all the brace
$\frak a_s\bet{\alpha_s}$"=images and of sums like
$\oper[-1]n\,(\frak a\bet\alpha)\+(\oper[-1]{\text\i}\circ\oper[-1]m)
(\frak a\bet\alpha)$. These replications do not change the
superposition statistics as a whole.

The aforesaid gives birth to a universal---stronger than $\approx$
and irrespective of instruments---""observational equivalence
relation
\begin{equation*}
\ketPsi\Approx\const\bo\cdot\ketPsi
\end{equation*}
on the space $\bbH$, \ie, the `physical' indistinguishability
(sect.~\ref{MM}).

The basis vectors $\ket{\alpha_s}$ and their ($\Approx$)"=equivalents
will be referred to as \emph{eigen vectors/states of instrument}
$\scr A$; clearly, the concepts of instrument and of
(macro)"=observation (\hyperlink{O}{\red\textsf{O}}) should now be
distinguished. Accordingly, the spectral construction
\eqref{spectr}--\eqref{spectr-} should be corrected. Call the data
set
\begin{equation}\label{spectr+}
\big\{\ket{\alpha_1}_{{\sss\lfloor}\alpha_1^{}},\,
\ket{\alpha_2}_{{\sss\lfloor}\alpha_2^{}},\, \ldots\big\}\FED
\bo[\scr A\bo]
\end{equation}
$\bo[\scr A\bo]$-\emph{representative} of instrument $\scr A$ in
$\bbH$. The add-on \eqref{spectr+} does not touch on $\bbH$"=space,
since the spectral labels $\vcenter{\Smaller[3]\lfloor}\alpha_j$ are
the self"=contained objects independently of vectors
$\ket{\alpha_k}$. These labels and their degenerations determine
`internal properties' of the formalized notion of an instrument
\eqref{spectr+}. Conversely, any state vector $\ketPsi$ or
$\frak c\bo\cdot\ketPsi$ may be treated as one element of the
$\bo[\scr C\bo]$"=representative for imagined/actual instrument
$\scr C$ (spectrum is arbitrary) and is a certain $(\h+)$-sum of the
eigen elements for any other $\bo[\scr A\bo]$"=representative.
Remembering \eqref{m2}, we arrive at the ultimate conclusion that
determines the (pre"=dynamical) theory of macroscopic data on
micro"=events.
\begin{itemize}
\item \embf{The core $\bo{(1}$-st\,$\bo)$ theorem of quantum
 empiricism.}\label{Theorem}
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item[1)] The mathematical representatives of physical observations
  and of preparations are the quantum states $\ketPsi$ and
  statistical mixtures of eigen $\ket{\alpha}$"=states
  \begin{equation}\label{mix'}
  \big\{\ket{\alpha_1}^{{\sss(}\varrho_1^{}\sss)},\;
  \ket{\alpha_2}^{{\sss(}\varrho_2^{}\sss)},\; \ldots\big\}\,,\qquad
  \varrho_1+\varrho_2+\cdots=1\,.
  \end{equation}

 \item[2)] Properties \eqref{axiom1}--\eqref{D'} define objects
  $\ketPsi$ as elements of a (complete separable) linear vector
  space $\bbH$ over the algebra of complex numbers~$\tilde\bbC^*$.

 \item[3)] Dimension $\dim\bbH=\texttt{D}\geqslant2$, representing an
  observable quantity ($\texttt{D}\ne\infty$), is set to the value
  $\msf{max}\,\{|\boT_{\!\sss\scr A}|, |\boT_{\!\sss\scr B}|,\ldots\}=
  \texttt{D}$ as required by an accuracy of the toolkit $\cal O=$
  $\{\scr A$, $\scr B$, \ldots\}. The eigen $\ket{\alpha}$"=vectors for
  each $\bo[\scr A\bo]$"=representative provide a basis of $\bbH$
  independently of spectra~\eqref{spectr+}.

 \item[4)] The $\scr A$"=bases stand out with that the
  numeric/""observational notion has been associated to
  them---statistics of the accumulative micro"=events. The statistics
  $\nu_k(\frak a)$ are invariant under involutions \eqref{inv2}, and
  states $\ketPsi$ and $\frak c\bo\cdot\ketPsi$ are statistically
  indistinguishable.

 \item[5)] Rules \eqref{axiom1}--\eqref{D'}, for a fixed
  $\texttt{D}\ne\infty$, are categorical as an axiomatic system; they
  admit no non"=isomorphic models.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
The words `complete separable' have been supplemented here for
mathematical reasons. This point is partly commented in
\cite{brezhnev}. Indeed, the algebra constructed above needs some
amendments of a topological nature because all the construction
contains three infinities: continuum $\bbC$, continuum $\bbH$, and
dimension \texttt{D}. In this connection, see the book \cite{pontr}.

To summarize: having considered the micro"=destruction arrays with
empirical rather than a formal take on arithmetic, ideology of
creating the quantitative theory leads to the key feature of quantum
states---addition thereof, and the `quantities under addition are
measured' by complex numbers.

\begin{comment}\label{units}
Again, as in sect.~\ref{qm+A}, we draw attention to a hidden and
(logically) unremovable extension of the physical units' concept.
\begin{itemize}
\item ``\ldots\ \emph{units}. Despite the rudimentary nature of units,
 they are probably the most inconsistently understood concept in all
 of physics \ldots\ where do units come from?'' \cite[p.~91]{gryb}.
\end{itemize}
Surprisingly, the na\"ive and straightforward conjunction of this
concept with an abstract number seems to\OK\ contravene the
multiplication arithmetic; but not the addition one. The typical
example illustrates the point:
\begin{equation*}
(2\,\,\textsf{kg})\times(3\,\,\textsf{kg})\ne6\,\,\textsf{kg}\qquad
(3\,\,\textsf{sheep}+5\,\,\psi\ne8\,\textsf{St\"uck})\,.
\end{equation*}
On the other hand, $2\times(3\,\,\textsf{kg})=6\,\,\textsf{kg}$ and
$(2\,\,\textsf{kg})+(3\,\,\textsf{kg})= 5\,\,\textsf{kg}$, and the \textsf{kg} may be
replaced here with any other entity: the classical metres, the
abstract `Quanten St\"ucke $\psi$', \etc. They have no any
operational significance, but one cannot get by without them.

The digital characters acquire their usual abstract"=numerical
meaning---mathematization \cite{ludwig5}---only when we throw the
`units' \{\textsf{St\"uck}, $^{\circ}$\!\!C, \textsf{sheep}, $\psi$, \ldots\}
out of data like \{5\,\textsf{St\"uck}, $5^{\circ}$\!\!C, 5\,\textsf{sheep},
$5\,\psi$, \ldots\}. The symbol `$5$' in $5^{\circ}$\!\!C is the very
same~`$5$' as in $5\bo\cdot\ket{\alpha}$. It is pointless without
such a matching/""abstracting. At the same time, an inversion of this
abstracting---attaching \{\textsf{St\"uck}, $^{\circ}$\!\!C, \textsf{sheep},
$\psi$, \ldots\} to the character~5---is always \emph{an interpretation
of abstraction}: interpretation `the \textsf{St\"uck}',
`$^{\circ}$\!\!C"=interpretation the Celsius', \etc. It is not
improbably that this is the only point, when completed quantum
theory---\qm/\qft/""quantum"=gravity yet to be constructed---will
resort to the word interpretation. See also comments by D.~Darling
concerning ``sheep, numbers, add, things'', \etc\ on p.~178 in the
book \cite{fuchs4}.
\end{comment}

Incidentally, within this (physical and quantum) context,
\begin{itemize}
\item the \lvs\ itself should be regarded as no less a primary
 math"=structure than the numbers themselves. Empiricism gives birth
 to both these structures simultaneously. Neither of them is
 more/""less abstract/""necessary than the other.
\end{itemize}
The habitual physics' construct
\hbox{$\lceil$$\textit{num\-ber}\times\textit{phy\-si\-cal unit\/}$$\rceil$}
exemplifies in effect a simplest (1"=dimensional) \lvs. However, the
structure `the \lvs', in contrast to the `bare' arithmetic, simply
`does not forget and keeps' an operator nature (unary
multiplication~$\bo\cdot$) of the structure `the number' and its
empirical inseparability from the notion of the unit. A direct
corollary of this point is the fact that the
principium~\hyperlink{II}{\red\textbf{\textsf{II}}} can in no way be given
up or disregarded. This would be tantamount to impossibility to
introduce the further empirical (and classical) notion of a physical
unit.

As we have seen, nothing above and beyond what was used in
constructing the mathematics \eqref{axiom1}--\eqref{D'} is required
to explain the meaning of the quantum state. Besides, we have
obtained not merely a completion of construction~\eqref{Repr}:
\begin{equation*}
{\bo\Oplus}(\frak a_1,\ket{\alpha_1};\frak a_2,\ket{\alpha_2})=
\frak a_1\bo\cdot\ket{\alpha_1}\h+\frak a_2\bo\cdot
\ket{\alpha_2}\h+\cdots\,.
\end{equation*}

In the first place, one establishes \emph{the genesis of the quantal
discontinuity: distinguishability of the micro $\state\alpha$"=events
is a discrete entity in the very nature of the perception
process}\footnote{This also bears on preparation $\SM$. Say, smooth
reducing the interferometer intensity is not an empiricism but an
imagination of the abstracta continuity/""infinity. Clearly, such an
(incorrect) substitution of the perception process should somewhere
be replaced with a `correct comprehension'---introduction of a
discrete event's category. The continuality in the perception of
(the classical) reality is an act of theorization, whereas the
nature of perception is fundamentally discrete.}
(sect.~\ref{observ}, Remark~\ref{two}). Accordingly,
``indivisibility, or ``individuality'', characterizing the elementary
processes'' (N.~Bohr \cite[p.~203]{schilpp}) must be formalized into
the \emph{`elemental' click}. We also clarify the formalization of
measurement/""preparation and of genesis of the $\bbC$"=numbers. The
well-known ($*$)"=conjugation operation also finds its origin.
Moreover, it is supplemented with a transposition
$\Re(\frak a)\rightleftarrows \Im(\frak a)$ of the real/""imaginary
part of the $\bbC$"=number, and this transposition should be regarded
just as natural operation as the conjugation. The emergent concepts
of spectra, of their degenerations and eigen"=states provide near
comprehensive mathematical image of physical observables. The state
becomes devoid its mysteriousness \cite{leifer, ney}, since it is
explicitly built in terms of the unique model of the `statistical'
$\ket{\alpha}$"=representatives supplemented with macroscopic
mixtures~\eqref{mix'}.

\subsection{Separation of the number matters}\label{divis}

The empirical adequacy of quantum theory can be based only on
empirical ensembles (sects.~\ref{A+S},~\ref{whyC}). Creation of
their mathematics tells us, then, that the `quantity of something'
\eqref{shema'}--\eqref{real'} turns into a formal operational
algebra through labeling the operator replications
(sects.~\ref{Dupl}--\ref{arif}) and yields the numbers proper. At
first, they emerge merely as
\begin{gather*}
\Over[2]{\Under[2]{\text{$\msf n$"=symbols of abstractions
\eqref{shema'}--\eqref{real} with ordering $<$}}}\hbox to0ex{\;}\\
\downarrow\qquad\quad\downarrow\\[-2ex]
\ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots
\end{gather*}
and then as internal objects of theory:
\begin{gather*}
\ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots\notag\\
\downarrow\qquad\quad\downarrow\\
\begin{array}{c}
\Over[2]{\Under[2]{\text{numbers $\msf n$ as elements of
arithmetic \eqref{distr}--\eqref{Ax}}}}\\[1ex]
\downarrow\qquad\quad\downarrow\\[1ex]
\Over[2]{\Under[2]{\text{$(\msf m,\msf n)$"=numbers $\frak a$ and
their $\tilde\bbC^*$"=algebra \eqref{g+}, \eqref{nma}--\eqref{riC},
\eqref{inv2}}}}
\end{array}\hbox to0ex{.}\\
\downarrow\qquad\quad\downarrow\\[-2ex]
\ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots
\end{gather*}
These steps are necessary and mean that not only are the complex
numbers far from self"=evident, but even the negative ones are; a key
place \eqref{g1}, \eqref{ab} wherein a group arises. All the other
structural points, first and foremost the observational quantities,
may be further produced (even as conceptions) only through certain
mathematical mappings:
\begin{gather}
\ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots\notag\\
\downarrow\qquad\quad\downarrow\notag\\
\Over[2]{\Under[2]{
\begin{array}{@{}c@{}}
\text{the observations numbers $\nu_s$ and $\alpha_s$:}\\[1ex]
\frak a_s\mapsto(\text{statistics }\nu_s), \quad
\ket{\alpha_s}\mapsto(\text{spectra }\alpha_s)\\[1ex]
\text{tensorial structure of the $\bbH$"=space}
\end{array}}}\hbox to0ex{\quad.}\label{star}
\end{gather}
In other words, if a concept is a numeric one already in
empiricism---frequencies, spectra, \etc---then its meaningful
formalization by means of a mathematical definitio can resort only
to a mathematics that we have at our disposal: \lvs\ and algebra of
numbers.

Thus numerical quantities in the entire theory are initially divided
up by their emergence mechanism
(\hyperlink{II}{\red\textbf{\textsf{II}}}): the intrinsic abstracta and
reifications \eqref{star}. Without such a division, the
\emph{circular logic is inevitable}, and the above"=mentioned `unit'
treatment of numbers would still be supplemented with the task of
their observational interpretation complicated by 2"=dimensionality.
This task would be present in formalism not merely as a problem but
as an inherently intractable challenge. Actually, \emph{any entity
can be identified with numbers}, and this is why, the quantum
empiricism and
principium~\hyperlink{II}{\red\textbf{\textsf{II}}}---paradigm of the very
number in a physical theory---insist on the need to pay the closest
possible attention to all these things.

\begin{comment}
In this regard, the situation has a parallel with the
familiar\look[?famous, well-known] history of electrodynamics of
moving bodies; as was pointed out just before wording the
principium~\hyperlink{III}{\red\textbf{\textsf{III}}}. Lorentz's
contraction theory is inconsistent, if the space"=time tags to events
are not linked up to the precise empirical
definitions---clocks/""simultaneity and rigid rods---in different
reference frames. In quantum case, the chief subject of empirical
definition is a concept of the number. Otherwise, the meaning of the
very notion of a quantitative theory has been blurring.
\end{comment}

We have seen now that there is no way of founding the theory only on
the observable categories (see Remark~\ref{two}), and resorting to
the physical notions---the camouflaged
\hyperlink{M}{\red\textsf{M}}"=observations---is prohibited. The
attempts to use statistics at the very beginning of the theory are
known \cite{moyal, hartle, ballentine, ballentine2, espagnat,
ludwig1, ludwig3}, and rightly so; they were initiated by
H.~Margenau (1936) \cite[Ch.~15]{auletta}. However, the scheme just
given is rigid. In order to obviate the premature appearance of the
very need for an interpretation, the scheme must not be varied.
Being a sequence of steps, it provides in essence an answer to the
principium~\hyperlink{II}{\red\textbf{\textsf{II}}}.

\subsection{Operations on numbers}\label{92}

The last step in this scheme contains, in particular, the map
$\frak a\mapsto\nu$, \ie, measurement \eqref{red}. Its form should
be established in its own right---Born's rule \cite{brezhnev}. To
illustrate, the na\"ive transformation of negative numbers $\msf p$
into the actually perceived quantities by a `seemingly natural' rule
like $|{\pm}\msf p|$ is not correct and does not follow from
anywhere. For the built algebra \eqref{axiom1}--\eqref{axiom3}, the
operation $\pm\msf p\mapsto |{\pm}\msf p|$ is extrinsic and illegal,
it is just not there. According to ideology of sect.~\ref{physmath},
not only objects---numbers, vectors, quantities, characteristics,
\etc---but also all the math operations should be created because
one without the other is meaningless. The more so as the numeric
object of the theory---the complex pair $(\pm\msf p,\pm\msf q)$---is
as yet single, it contains a principally `non"=materializable'
ingredient (sect.~\ref{C}) and behaves as a whole. As regards
empiricism, the negative and the $\bbC$"=numbers are equally
`nonexistent, fictitious entities', since the state's mathematics
\eqref{axiom1}--\eqref{axiom3} has not been supplemented with the
doctrine of `empirically perceived' quantities \eqref{star}. In
fact, the step-by-step transformation of the binary operation $\cup$
to symbols $\uplus$, $\+$, $\Uplus$ and, finally, to operations
$\{\h+,\bo\cdot,\oplus,\odot\}$ does not terminate at states.
Algebra \eqref{axiom1}--\eqref{axiom3} will be further required to
create now the mathematically correct calculation rules of the
proper observational quantities.

The foregoing is amplified by the fact that
pr.~\hyperlink{II}{\red\textbf{\textsf{II}}} has been involved in the
classical description and in vindication/""refutation of, say, the
hidden variable theories. Here, numbers are identified with the
reified quantities, and subtraction is taken for granted from the
outset. However, the negative quantities are also being created
here, and they are constructed in the same manner as with the
`quantum zero' for the \itsf{H}"=group in sect.~\ref{ssuper}.

Indeed, the readings and physical quantities are not numbers but no
more than notches, and `negative notches' are introduced prior to
mathematics of symbols according to the following subconsciously
intended scheme. The self"=apparent physical conventionality, which
has been calling `an addition' of two such notches, must produce, in
accordance with the supra"=mathematical requirements of physics, what
is named `nought, zero'. Two waves at a point, for instance,
compensate each other. The result is asserted to be identical with a
zero the mathematical, and that is the subtraction. The classical
`explanations' are the ones with use of compensations/""subtractions
(see Remark~\ref{13}), whereas \emph{the minus} we have accustomed
\emph{is a fairly abstract construction in its own right}; ``half an
apple is easier to understand than a negative apple!''
\cite[p.~37]{baez+}. In this respect one might state that the very
classical physics needs an interpretation---in terms of strictly
positive `the number of St\"ucke'. Mathematization of empiricism
into numbers is not a distinctive feature of quantum description.
However, comprehension of `abstracting the minus sign' is not
confined even to this. A word of explanation is necessary with
regard to the situation.

Mathematics formalizes \cite{kurat} the positive/""negative
$\pm\msf p$ into the pairs' classes $(m,n)$ being equivalent with
respect to an `adding' of the class $(\ell,\ell)$ (the `zero'):
\begin{gather}
(+\msf m)\DEF(m,0) \approx(m+\ell,0+\ell)\,,\qquad
(-\msf n)\DEF(0,n) \approx(0+\ell,n+\ell)\,,\notag\\
\label{pair}
\pm\msf p\quad\hhence\quad(\msf m-\msf n)\DEF(m,n)\approx(m+\ell,n+\ell)\,,
\end{gather}
where $m,n,\ell$ are to be seen as `something strictly positive'.
This `adding' is yet another tacitly assumed and much more abstract
action: addition of objects of some other kind---`positive couples'
$(m,n)$. Technically, at an appropriate place of
sect.~\ref{Numbers}, we had to introduce such classes and to assign
their own algebraic operations for them. The result might be called
the `genuine' arithmetic (of `the positives') and could be enlarged
to the `complete arithmetic' with multiplication and division.

In consequence, the single"=token object $(+\msf m)$ or $(-\msf n)$,
which we perceive as self"=evident
(cf.~pr.~\hyperlink{II}{\red\textbf{\textsf{II}}}), is a rather unobvious
construction---the generic equivalence-class of two"=token
$(m,n)$"=abstractions \eqref{pair}. Essence of the symbol of a
negative number $(-\msf n)$ is revealed only when contrasting the
two positive ones. Exactly the same situation has occurred when
deriving the superposition principle in \eqref{o+}--\eqref{g1} and
\eqref{ab}. It is clear that once all the $\pm\msf p$"=numbers, and
the `normal' positive~$+\msf p$'s among, have been formalized into
the equivalences \eqref{pair}, the fact that they possess any
`natural meanings'---like `operation of the quantity
$\msf p\mapsto|\msf p|$' invented above---becomes more than
unnatural. The abstract class operations that appear out of nowhere.
Similarly with $\bbQ$"=numbers and their $\bbR$"=extension: classes of
equivalent pairs $(\msf n/\msf m)\DEF(n,m)\approx(n\,\ell,m\,\ell)$.

\subsection{Naturalness of abstracta}

We thus infer that rejection or disregard of the similar `naturally
abstract' set"=theoretic models would be tantamount to rejection of
the minus sign even in the elementary physics. This is an absurd,
but its root is a need for abstracting. On the other hand, the
motivated deduction of these models cannot be replaced with (hidden)
axiomatic assumptions. Such an ambivalence is, in our view, one
reason why the problem with `decrypting' quantum postulates is so
difficult, because it touches upon the metamathematical (and
metaphysical) aspects of the very thinking \cite{kleene, chomsky,
harin, knott}. The stream of subconsciously abstractive
homomorphisms\footnote{For a philosophical discussion to these
representations and the origin of models, see pages 1--230 in
\cite{wart}. As one more comment concerning the abstracting/""realism,
we refer to the first half of a letter from A.~Einstein to H.~Samuel
in \cite[pp.~157--160]{einstein1}; see also \cite{einstein2}.} is
considerable and is always larger than it seems. In
sects.~\ref{Ans}--\ref{minus}, we have described not all of them.
`Difficulties' with complex numbers, strictly speaking, should
already be attributed to the level of the usual negative ones.
Bearing in mind that the `minus' comes from the equal sign~$=$
\cite{mazur} and the equality comes from the scheme
$\eqref{o+}\rightarrowtail\eqref{g1}$, both the
principia---\hyperlink{II}{\red\textbf{\textsf{II}}} and
\hyperlink{III}{\red\textbf{\textsf{III}}}---are very important (and
functioning) also in the classical case. In quantum case, they are
just fundamentally unavoidable for the very creating the theory. The
nature of \qm\ theory, of arithmetic, of complex numbers, and of
their algebras is one and the same.

Transferring the reasoning above to the natural numbers $\bb N$, the
degrees of classical and quantum abstraction become even
indistinguishable. Empirical motivation leads, in one way or
another, to the standard von~Neumann's representation for ordinals
\begin{equation}\label{ordinal}
0\DEF\varnothing\,,\qquad1\DEF\{\varnothing\}\,,\qquad
2\DEF\{\varnothing,\{\varnothing\}\}\,,\qquad
3\DEF\{\varnothing,\{\varnothing \},\{\varnothing,
\{\varnothing\}\}\}\,,\qquad\ldots\,,
\end{equation}
\ie, to using the \zf"=axiom of union: $n+1\DEF n\cup\{n\}$
\cite{kurat}. Therefore less obvious is the $\bb N$"=numbers
themselves, to be followed by the ordering $<$, topologies,
extensions, generalizations, \etc. The formal characterization of
all the experimental reduces then to the successive creating from
the set"=theoretic atoms---unions of sets---some direct products
thereof and mappings into other constructions of the same kind.
Hence, both the physical images `being under a ban above' and
auxiliary structures---dimensionalities, orders, \etc---should
equally well become homomorphisms onto certain formal constructions
regardless of the description's classicality/""quantumness. The
presence of, say, non"=binary operations \eqref{inv2} does not stand
out, because their nature does not differ from the one of (habitual)
subtraction and of division. All of these are involutory structures
that have been mathematically inherited from the empirical
meta"=requirements: repetitions
(\hyperlink{M}{\red\textsf{M}}"=paradigm), physics $\SM$, and
invariance~\hyperlink{III}{\red\textbf{\textsf{III}}} (sect.~\ref{SS}).

To close the section we add that the distancing the concepts of
state/\texttt{DataSource} and of a physical property is the
continuation of a more primary idea---detaching the proper
macro"=perceptions from what is being \emph{represented}
theoretically \cite{wart, ludwig1, ludwig3}. This issue, as B.~Mazur
has noted in \cite[p.~2]{mazur}, ``has been with us \ldots\ forever: the
general question of abstraction, as separating what we want from
what we are presented'', \ie, the separating the `bare' empiricism
from mathematics with $\Sigma$"=limit and the number. The atomic
constituent of perception---and of sensory experience---is an
elementary quantum event \cite{ludwig3, hart, ulfbeck}, and it
begins and terminates, in effect, in
$(\not\approx_{\!\!\!\sss\scr A})$"=distinguishability of
$\state\alpha$"=clicks (sect.~\ref{S}). Any the continual is a
`speculative theory' (act of abstracting), not the underlying
empiricism. Therefore all the further matters---numbers, arithmetic,
space"=time, cause/""effect, (non)inertial reference frames, the
notions of an observer/""event/""coordinates in the relativity theory
(\ie, a quantum view of the equivalence principle), device `readings
off', composite systems, \etc---no matter how self"=evident---are the
math add-on's, which could originate only in the `$\cup$"=theory' of
sect.~\ref{EmpMath}. Following von~Weizs\"acker, it might be called
the `Ur"=theory'. There are no contradictions in observations
themselves, whether we call them macro- or micro"=scopic.
Contradictions do arise in the `math\a={e}maticae being
constructed'.

\subsection{States and measurement}\label{SM}

The source of the numerous treatments of \qm\ \cite[Ch.~10]{home},
\cite[Ch.~10]{laloe}, \cite{auletta, schloss4, schloss3, saunders,
zeilinger3}---and `the Copenhagen' among---is the fact that the
$\state\alpha$"=event and subconscious comprehension of $\state\Psi$
(pt.~\hyperlink{S}{\red\textsf{S}}) are a~priori endowed with physical
properties, with observational characteristics of the
\texttt{DataSource}, and with operationality of the canonical
\qm"=concept $\ketPsi$\footnote{An illustrative example in this
regard is one of the first sentences from Everett's PhD: ``The state
function $\psi$ is thought of as objectively characterizing the
physical system \ldots\ at all times \ldots\ independently of our state of
knowledge of it'' \cite[p.~3]{everett}, \cite[p.~73]{barrett}; and
also, on p.~8, ``The general validity of pure wave mechanics,
\textsl{without any statistical assertions}, is assumed for \textsl{all}
physical systems, including observers and measuring apparata''. And,
again Everett's: ``The physical `reality' is assumed to be the wave
function of the whole universe itself'' \cite[p.~100]{freire},
\cite[p.~70]{barrett}.}. However, none of these initially exist. The
primitive $\state\alpha$"=events' abstractions
$\statePsi\GOTO{\sss\scr A}\state\alpha$ are all there is. An
important point is that even the `eigen $\state\alpha$"=click' (of a
photon/""electron say, in the \textsc{epr}"=experiment) should not be
identified with an $\ket{\alpha}$"=state. The latter is
re"=developable with respect to eigen"=states associated with other
click-sets of any other instruments:
\begin{equation*}
\ket{\alpha_j}=\frak b_1\bo\cdot\ket{\beta_1}\h+
\frak b_2\bo\cdot\ket{\beta_2}\h+\cdots=
\frak c_1\bo\cdot\ket{\gamma_1}\h+
\frak c_2\bo\cdot\ket{\gamma_2}\h+\cdots=\cdots\,,
\end{equation*}
which is why it is logically meaningless to attribute one
$\state\alpha_k$-click to that which carries statistics of other
clicks $\state\beta_k$, $\state\gamma_k$, \ldots\ and has nothing in
common with $\state\alpha$. All the more so the click may not be
related with such physically descriptive collocations as `the
measuring act on Bob's electron reveals the spin-up'. As in the `cat
case' (sect.~\ref{cat}), the spin-up here is a click-up rather than
a state $\ket{{}{\uparrow}}$. Similarly, a click (ostensibly of a
photon) with Alice/Bob has nothing in common with distance between
them (the locality `problem'), with speed of light, or with a
kinematic `comprehension' of the photon. Likewise, the
math"=properties of the eigen $\ket{\alpha}$---and of the abstract
$\ketPsi$---can in no way be `syncretized' with
$\state\alpha$"=events, when the clicks are as yet being accumulated.
The screen click is not a photon and photon is not a click. The
click should not be an element of the language in which
$\ketPsi$"=terminology, numbers and physical properties have been
employed whatsoever. B.~Englert \cite[p.~8]{englert} does stress
with emphasis the ``folklore that ``a measurement leaves the system in
the relevant eigenstate'' \ldots\ It is puzzling that some textbook
authors consider it good pedagogy to elevate this folklore to an
``axiom'' of quantum theory''. See also the 2-nd epigraph to
sect.~\ref{S0}.

Then something subsequently referred to as a state (the abstract)
and a measurement (the concrete) is created. However, as already
stressed in sect.~\ref{MM}, process of abstracting---the
set"=theoretic homomorphisms
$\{\statePsi,\cup\}\rightarrowtail\cdots\rightarrowtail\{\ketPsi,\h+,
\bo\cdot\}$---is a rather multistage one
(sects.~\ref{Ans}--\ref{minus}), and reduction of this long sequence
`for physical reasons' does always contain phenomenological axioms
a~priori. Clearly, in the reverse direction we confront
hard-to"=disentangle assumptions and the well-known axiomatic cycle.

In order to avoid paradoxes like `quantum cat' (``state vector does
not describe \ldots\ a single cat'' \cite[p.~37]{ballentine0}), `the
presence of a particle here and there', or like `quantum
bomb"=testing' (Elitzur--Vaidman) \cite{auletta, greenstein},
\begin{itemize}
\item it is imperative to require a severe conceptual
 differentiation\footnote{T.~Maudlin: ``\ldots\ we need to keep the
 distinction between mathematical and physical entities sharp.
 Unfortunately, the usual terminology makes this difficult''
 \cite[p.~129]{maudlin}. Even indirect usage of the terminology that
 came from the classical description can be a source of confusing.
 For example, so"=called exchange interaction as a `cause of
 correlation' between identical parts of system.} between term `the
 state' and `physically sounding' adjectives/""verbs and the
 spatial/""cause"=effect images.
\end{itemize}
It seems preferable to radicalize the non"=connectivity of these
categories, \ie, to proclaim it a postulate. For instance, a
boldface italics in Remark~\ref{Qcat} or selected thesis at the end
of sect.~\ref{2slit}. At least, the differentiation between them
should not be neglected in reasoning, inasmuch as it seems
unrealistic to change the deeply ingrained \cite[p.~7]{touzalin} and
ill"=defined turns of terminology such as ``photon is in a certain
\emph{state of polarization}'' \cite[p.~5]{dirac}, `an observable
has/""acquires a (numeric) value when being measured' \cite[p.~310;
critique]{ludwig2}, ``outcome of a measurement'' \cite{auletta, home,
laloe}, or `simultaneous measurability' (see sect.~\ref{S} and
pr.~\hyperlink{I}{\red\textbf{\textsf{I}}}), \ie, as if we've had some
\emph{micro}"=phys prior to math. No, there is nothing a~priori
(sect.~\ref{observ}). With this mixing, circular logic pointed out
in Remark~\ref{meta} will be present at all times. See, for
instance, pages 29--30 in the work \cite{foulis0} and notably an
emphasized warning by D.~Foulis about ``\emph{a mistake, and a
serious one\/}!'', including criticism addressed to von~Neumann on
p.~29.

The principled abstractness of the $\ketPsi$"=object is a core
feature of quantum theory as compared with the classical one. In
other words,
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{the} interpretation of the quantum state \emph{is its
 very definiendum}. Even with the physical terminology created,
 there may be only one paraphrase for the meaning to a state: an
 abstract element of the abstract\footnote{The point~4) in Theorem
 determines a supplement---the numeric add-on to the (`completely
 bare') abstract \lvs.} linear (not Hilbert) vector space over
 $\bbC^*$.
\end{itemize}
The `not Hilbert' because the norm and inner"=product are the
extra---nonessential---math add-on's over $\bbH$, which come from
the descriptive physical notions (that follow), from a measurement,
and from Born's rule \cite{brezhnev}. The state, in and of itself,
needs no and knows nothing of them. They will be required
\emph{further}, not now, for calculation---math"=calculus--of
observable quantities: statistics $\nu_k$ and means. In a nutshell,
we may not blend the fundamentally abstract part of quantum
mathematics---pre"=phys and the structural properties of
$\bbH$---with those which is in charge of its observational/""physical
constituent. See also Remark~\ref{two} and warnings by G.~Ludwig ``of
a mistake. \ldots\ false notion that ``mathematical objects'' must be
pictures of physical objects'' \cite[p.~228]{ludwig4} and of a
``reality [of the] word ``state,'' a reality in which one must not
believe!'' \cite[p.~78]{ludwig5}. A.~Peres also makes special note of
the analogous: ``\ldots\ physicists have been tempted to elevate the
state vector $\psi$ to the status of substitute of reality''
\cite[p.~645]{peres0}.

The most illustrative example is the (in)famous problem of
measurement, which is the subject of ``the mountains of literature''
\cite[p.~118]{ludwig4} containing opposing opinions \cite{kampen,
home, laloe, london, mittel, mittel2}, and which is the source of
questions around locality in \qm. The point here, put very briefly,
is that the measuring `problem' is one of principle, not of
practice. As we have seen, this problem is a nonexistent as well as
a pseudo one \cite[p.~79(!)]{ludwig3}, \cite[p.~118(!)]{ludwig4},
\cite{edwards} because in measurements nothing either propagates
(much less at superluminal speeds), nor is anything collapsed
\cite[sect.~XVII.4.3]{ludwig2}, \cite[p.~328]{laloe},
\cite{ballentine0, ludwig5}, nullified, localized, there are no such
things as quantum jumps \cite{zeh}, and no pieces of the wave
function are cut out.

J.~Bub and I.~Pitowsky, on p.~453 of \cite{saunders}, do insist that
presumptions ``about the ontological significance of the quantum
state and about the dynamical account of how measurement outcomes
come about, should be rejected as unwarranted dogmas about quantum
mechanics''.

Again (see p.~\pageref{povtor} and sect.~\ref{phys}), direct or
indirect attempts to physically\OK\ characterize the state
function---like
\hbox{$\ket{{}\text{dead}}\h+\ket{{}\text{alive}}$}---are hopeless,
since it is the very \texttt{DataSource}/""information around which all
corresponding objects and the language phrases---readings,
frequencies and other quantities---are only slated to create. It is
impossible to `reconcile' the (nonclassical) concept of a quantum
state with any its \emph{observational prototypes}.
\begin{itemize}
\item It is not allowed to handle this term in the way we are doing
 this with a state in the classical physics; even philosophically
 (see the selected theses at the end of sect.~\ref{StatPh} and at
 the beginning of sect.~\ref{MM}).
\end{itemize}
The appeals regarding the irrelevance of the projective postulate
are often encountered in the literature, though \cite{hartle,
slavnov3, lipkin, klyshko, peres0, gottfried, ludwig3, ludwig4,
ludwig5}.

Another example of circular logic is the critiqued \cite{home,
stapp, stapp2} meaning of the phrase ``an ensemble of similarly
prepared systems'' \cite{ballentine, home, saunders}. The complete
revision of this idea, as was set forth above, does, in fact,
demonstrate that, like in the ensemble approaches, ``\qm\ is a usual
statistical theory'' \cite{ballentine}, \cite[p.~123]{ludwig5},
\cite[p.~223]{mises}, \cite{ballentine2, hren1, allah, ludwig3,
ludwig5, silverman, moyal, muynck} with a frequency content of the
randomness and with the classical logic \cite{ludwig5} but with a
different mathematics of statistic's calculus. It is different due
to the fact that the theory is not tied, as in classical
description, to the notion of an observable quantity, and the
$\nu$'s are calculated through the `other/""abstract' numbers
\cite{brezhnev}. However, for the same reason the emphasizing of a
close resemblance with the classical statistical mechanics
\cite{faddeev, mackey}, \cite[p.~72]{everett} or `explanations' with
coins/""dice/""cards \etc\ are in error.

\subsection{Interpretations and self-referentiality}

Although we have not yet touch on other significant attributes---the
means over statistics, operators, and products of $\bbH$"=spaces will
be considered in their own rights, it is clear that the need to
quest for a description in terms of hidden variables is also
eliminated. Even from a formalistic perspective, the proof of
presence/""absence \cite{neumann, dmitr, greenstein} of these
`physical' quantities should be attributed to the semantic
conclusions of meta"=theory (\,$=$~physics) \cite{raseva}, \ie, to
theorems \emph{about} formal theory rather than to theorems of its
\emph{inner} calculus. In our case, and more generally, the formal
theory is the syntactical axioms of \qm. The corollaries of such
axioms are inherently unable to lead to statements about
interpretations \cite{raseva}, since theorems \emph{about}
object"=theory itself is not provable by means \emph{of} its
object"=language \cite{shenfield, raseva}.

A similar line of reasoning has accompanied quantum theory for quite
a while: ``claim that the formalism by itself can generate an
interpretation is unfounded and misleading'' (L.~Ballentine
\cite{ballentine0}). It is known that even the mathematics itself
cannot be defined in a self"=contained way \cite{frenkel, kleene}.
All of this stands in stark contrast with the known statement of
DeWitt to the effect that ``mathematical formalism of the quantum
theory is capable of yielding its own interpretation'' \cite[p.~160,
165, 168]{dewitt} or that ``conventional statistical interpretation
of quantum mechanics thus emerges from the formalism itself''
\cite[p.~185]{dewitt}. Especially, if we take account of the fact
that it is not the theory itself, but only its (formal)
interpretation that determines the very semantic terms
truth/""falsity/""provability of sentences (G\"odel). In turn, there may
be more than one such interpretation. See also
\cite[p.~310]{jammer}, \cite{benioff}, and specifically Ch.~III
in~\cite{kleene}. In other words, the subconscious striving for `to
interpret'---and transporting the macro into the micro---is the very
thing that prevents us from truly gaining an understanding of
quantum mathematics.

In any case, the fact that we were initially constructing the
set"=theoretic model (cf.~\cite{benioff})) rather than an
interpretation simply eliminates the problem, or, at most, transfers
it into the domain of questions regarding the micro"=transitions
$\GOTO{\sss\scr A}$ and $\boT$"=family as employed entities (see
Remark~\ref{two}). This is the domain of questions, which invoke the
set theory at all. Be this as it may, logic---formalized or
non---does not allow us to make statements about statements, much
less a statement that refers to itself. The self"=referentiality
(``von~Neumann catastrophe'') is almost the main trouble \cite{mittel,
muynck} encountered in quantum foundations. All of this, of course,
does not depend on whether interpretation is built over in a
strictly formalized \cite{shenfield} or in a physically natural
form. In effect, the issue of interpretations---in the rigorous
definition sense \cite[Ch.~2]{raseva}, \cite{shenfield},
\cite{stoll}---is simply nonexistent. Accordingly, the
demystification of the known and the quest for ontological
interpretations to $\frak a$"=coordinates of the $\ketPsi$"=vector
\cite{auletta, fine, hartle}---the wave function---is no longer a
problem, and with it disappears the Feynman question of ``the
\emph{only} consistent interpretation of this quantity''
\cite[p.~22]{feynman}. See also M.~Leifer's review \cite{leifer} and
extensive list of references therein.

\subsection{`Math-assembler' and philosophy}\label{phil}

Remembering and continuing sect.~\ref{physmath}, it is generally
tempting to infer that when creating the theory, we may not rest on
any meanings that are tacitly associated with the typical
terminology---no matter physical or mathematical---and should also
be very cautious about the wording of statements concerning the
phenomena outside the everyday experience. To illustrate, even the
very natural utterances---`here/there' (locality),
`big(ger)/small(er)' (quantitative statements), `let a two"=particle
$\cal S$', `electron \emph{with} Alice/Bob', `consisting of \ldots',
`subsystem $\cal S_1$ in such-and-such system $\cal S$'---are
actually ``(apparently) ``plausible'' conclusions from the observed
phenomena'' \cite[p.~334]{ludwig2}. These have already comprised an
equivalent of a measurement/""preparation (sect.~\ref{mixture}) and of
physical (pre)images, and thereby imitate the way of thinking and
schemes of classical mechanics. `Here/""there, bigger/""smaller,
this/another, \etc' is already a theory, and classical at that.

At the other extreme is an attempt to `hurry up' and bring the
reasoning to a Hilbert"=space theory or to the quantum mixtures
\eqref{mix'}. As in sect.~\ref{2slit}, all this may well be
non"=correct \cite{maudlin}. For example, such collocation as the
``system \embf{in} a superposition'' \cite{ludwig3, ludwig4}, in the
strict sense of the word, `should be banned' already at the
philosophical/""linguistic level. A source of antinomies is in
implicit implying, \ie, in the eclectic---this we stress once
again---confounding of observations, clicks, numbers, physics,
maths, and imagination, followed by the \emph{uncontrollable}
lexical"=`branching'. From this, there result the sense messes,
well-known \hbox{no-go} (meta)theorems\footnote{``\ldots\ combined with
some peculiar terminology, has led to confusion \ldots\ A woefully
common feature, \ldots\ each protagonist had some interpretation of the
quantum state in mind, but never stated clearly what it was''
(L.~Ballentine \cite[pp.~2, 6]{ballentine4}).} \cite{bell,
greenberg}, the locality `problem in \qm', and paradoxes like
\textsc{epr} \cite[sect.~XVII.4.4]{ludwig2} or the jocular Bell
question ``Was the world wave function waiting to jump for thousands
of millions of years \ldots\ for some more highly qualified measurer
--- with a Ph.D.?'' \cite[p.~117]{bell}, \cite[p.~18]{laloe},
\cite{lipkin, klyshko}. Clearly, quantum effects of observations do
not depend on whether the personified---homo sapiens---or biological
observer (Heisenberg--Zeilinger dog \cite[pp.~171--174]{hren3},
\cite{englert, englert2}) perceives them. The observer---without his
``subjective features'' (W.~Heisenberg) or ``the anthropomorphic
notions ``specifying'' and ``knowing''\,\,'' \cite[p.~645]{peres0}---is
just a formally logical element \hyperlink{O}{\red\textsf{O}} in
theory. Without numbers, solely a quantitative theory is not
possible (sect.~\ref{2slit}), because the entire terminology becomes
indefinite.

Thus, once a mathematics and \emph{unambiguous} language---spectra,
means, and macroscopic dynamical models---have been created, not
only is there no longer a need to call on the `otherworldly' or
anthropic explanation ways, but the very presence of a certain share
of mysticism, of subjec\-ti\-vi\-ty, and of (circum-)philosophy---``a
philosophical \textsl{\"Uberbau}'' \cite[p.~12]{englert}---in quantum
foundations becomes extremely questionable. G.~Ludwig is much more
thoroughgoing in the assessment---``philosophical gymnastics''
\cite[p.~79]{ludwig3}. There is no longer any freedom to invent
exegeses (of `the quantum"=postulate Bible`). Moreover, the freedom
to ask questions is no longer there, since the created
object"=language of states, of spectra, and of frequencies narrows
down the entire admissible lexicon. It may generate questions that
are not only ill"=posed but should, as in sect.~\ref{2slit}, be
qualified as ``meaningless'' \cite[p.~422]{nahman}. For example, those
that are based on an \emph{intuitive} perception of the term
observation by human being or questions about `the underlying nature
of reality', the notion of a `physical level of rigor' with regard
to the grounds of quantum theory and, in general, the pondering over
`how the world should function' at the micro"=level
\cite[p.~100]{ludwig5}.

In the classical paradigm, the language sentences are always
interrelated, since, one way or another, \emph{all} of them refer to
the observational concepts. These in fact form our natural speech
when describing experiments. The language intuition usually makes it
easy for us to do away with paradoxes the semantic closedness
causes. However, the quantum situation is just the one of a misuse
of the vocabulary, \ie, when contradictions are inevitable. This
fact---thinking (even if partly/""implicitly) in terms of physical
influences between the classical objects (D.~Deutsch's ``bad
philosophy'') but with `quantum conclu\-sions'---is the very source of
paradoxes, since the human intuition has roots in the classical
world and is a rather problematic and personal category. (A.~Stairs:
``Don't trust intuition'' \cite[p.~256]{stairs}; it is not meant for
\qm). Because of this, quantum theory must begin with a rudimentary
language, and it should be independent of our intuitive knowledge,
which ``tend to declare war on our deductions'' (van~Fraassen). In
order to avoid collisions between theory and meta"=language, the
subconscious striving of the natural language to include one in the
other has to be limited; see Remark~\ref{meta}. Einstein adds also
the situations when ``er f\"uhrt dazu, \"uberhaupt alle sprachlich
ausdr\"uckbaren S\"atze als sinnleer zu erkl\"aren''
\cite[p.~33]{einstein}. A.~Leggett's comments on ``pseudoquestions''
and ``gibberish'' at the end of sect.~\ref{super} may then be
strengthened so that the meaninglessness should become an element of
language, including the language of `philosophy of quanta'.
\begin{itemize}
\item The\label{forbiden} rudimentary quantum (meta)mathematics creates
 the notion of a \emph{prohibited
 statement/""question}\footnote{Cf.~the 't~Hooft remark: ``I go along
 with everything [Copenhagen] says, except for one thing, and the
 one thing is you're not allowed to ask any questions''.}, one that
 is devoid of meaning. These sentences, which involve classical
 analogies in circumvention of 1) the $\ket{\alpha}$"=representatives
 to the non"=interpretable abstraction $\ketPsi$ and 2) of the
 numerical quantities' nature (sect.~\ref{divis}).
\end{itemize}
See also pages 234--235 in \cite{schilpp} with Bohr's appeals
regarding the ``necessity of a radical revision of basic principles
for physical explanation \ldots\ revision of the foundation for the
unambiguous use of elementary concepts'' and his comment on words
``phenomena'', ``observations'', ``attributes'', and ``measurements'' on
p.~237.

The literature on this subject, even taking only the qualified
sources into account, is vast \cite{aaronson, barrett2, alter,
deutsch, espagnat, fine, fuchs4, greenberg, Hooft, maudlin, mermin,
mermin2, ney, saunders, schloss, schloss3, greenstein, kadom, hren1,
laloe, home, stapp2, auletta} and abounds with terminology---``\ldots\
words, \emph{ostensibly} English'' (A.~Leggett \cite[p.~300; emphasis
ours]{laloe}), that completely defies translation into the language
of events or of concretization: observer's consciousness,
parallel/""branching universes/worlds, free will, catalogue of
knowledge, world branch, and also such collocations as rational
agent, information (``\emph{Whose}'' and ``about \emph{what}'', by
J.~Bell) has been recorded/""transmitted/(not)reached an observer
(Wigner's friend), teleporting a state, many-minds/worlds/words,
quantum psychology, psycho"=physical parallelism (in this connection,
see \cite[p.~86(!)]{chomsky}), and many other ``bad words'', according
to Bell \cite[p.~215]{bell}.

Of course, ``without philosophy, science would lose its critical
spirit and would eventually become a technical device''
\cite[p.~800]{auletta} but, on the other hand, ``the concept of the
free will cannot be defined by indications on devices''
\cite[p.~151]{ludwig4} and ``one must not confuse physics with
philosophy'' \cite[p.12]{englert}. As concerns the attitudes towards
\qm---at the suggestion of M.~Tegmark in the 1990's, there even
carried out polls and statistical analysis of their correlations
\cite{zeilinger3}. There are also known attempts to involve here the
biology of consciousness/brain \cite{stapp2, tegmark},
\cite[sect.~6]{schloss6}, \cite[Ch.~9]{schloss}. Regarding them,
however, there have been not merely sceptical but quite opposite
opinions \cite[sects.~5--6]{wiseman}, \cite[\S\,XII.5(!)]{ludwig4}. Of
special note is Ballentine's remark ``to stop talking about
``consciousness'' or ``free will'' on the last page of the preprint
\cite{ballentine4}.

As a result, we gain ``a contribution to philosophy, but not to
physics'' \cite[p.~86]{mackin}. At the same time, the proposed math
`$\cup$"=assembler'
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{\statePsi\GOTO[3]{\Smaller[2]{\scr A}}\state\alpha\,,\qquad
\text{$\obj{\state\Xi}$"=brace \eqref{split'}\,,\qquad
$(\Vee,\in,\cup)$"=`logic' \eqref{union}--\eqref{cup}}}
\end{equation*}
is quite sufficient for creating the object"=language. Giving a
natural form to it would be acceptable, however, it is clear that
the set"=theoretic $\cup$"=base of the language cannot be avoided
\cite{benioff}. Nevertheless, the syntactically more formal
description of transitions/brace/""numbers is surely of interest and
value. This would turn, however, all the above material into a
mathematical logic text, what is we eschew in the present work. It
is probably for this reason that the very important and extremely
thorough works\footnote{Pre"=theories, 76 axioms
\cite[p.~241]{ludwig3}, ordered sets, morphisms, absence of the word
superposition in \cite{ludwig1, ludwig3}, (valid) criticism of
``theories of states'' \cite{ludwig5}, \etc.} by G\"unther Ludwig
\cite{ludwig1, ludwig2, ludwig3, ludwig4} and by his school are
often left out of the literature on quantum foundations. Among other
things, in spite of explicit pointing out a ``solution in principle
of the measuring problem'' in \cite[p.~V]{ludwig3} (and subtitle
``Derivation of Hilbert Space Structure'' of \cite{ludwig3}), name of
this author has not been mentioned in the detailed reviews
\cite{leifer, schloss4, zurek} and even in the books
\cite{silverman, fuchs4, schloss, mittel, saunders, ney}.

\subsection{Well, where's probability?}

An answer to this question in quantum theory is brief
enough---nowhere, because ``There is no probability meter''
(S.~Saunders \cite[p.~185]{saunders}) and relationship of this
concept with empiricism is unique \cite[p.~46]{ballentine2}---the
frequencies $\{\nu_j\}$. Cf.~the famous de~Finetti (1970) remark
``probability does not exist'' \cite{fuchs4} and A.~Khrennikov's
comment ``It seems that the machinery of randomness has no
applications in quantum physics. Experimenters are only interested
in \ldots\ frequencies'' \cite[p.~36]{hren9}. Or, expressed differently
by von~Mises' words,
\begin{quote}
``If we base the concept of probability, \emph{not on} the notion of
relative frequency, \ldots\ at the end of the calculations, the meaning
of the word 'probability' \emph{is silently changed} from that
adopted at the start to a definition based on the concept of
frequency'' \cite[p.~134]{mises} (emphasis ours).
\end{quote}
Otherwise, quantum foundations would \emph{require an
interpretation} of Kolmogorov's axioms, and the latter, in turn,
require interpreting the concept of the number---an axiomatic add-on
\emph{over} the ZF~theory \cite{kurat}. Bearing in mind the primary
nature of numbers and nontriviality of their emergence in a physical
theory (sect.~\ref{arif}), it is not just impossible to avoid the
relative frequencies \cite[p.~25]{peres}. Logic forbids them from
being subsidiary with reference to probability in any
definition:\?[Логика запрещает для них быть вторичными по отношению
к вероятности в любом определении] ``probability is the picture for
reproducible frequencies; and it is the [only] prescription for a
correct experiment'' \cite[p.~144]{ludwig4}. Pauli, among the few,
had been convinced that ``the concept of `probability' should not
occur in the fundamental laws of a satisfying physical theory'' (an
excerpt from Pauli's letter to Bohr in~1925).

The ensemble empiricism, for its part, is
self"=sufficient\footnote{In this connection we cannot agree with
statement of theorem~III in van~Kampen's work \cite{kampen} and with
further comment as to ``a single system'' and ``calculation of
spectra''.}, and the only conventionality within it is an infinite
number of repetitions. Its formalization is an appropriate axiom
\emph{in} the ZF"=theory \cite{kurat, haus}. Expressed another way,
any non"=frequency framework for what we have been calling
\qm"=probability `attracts vague justifications' in terms of its
surrogates: potentiality, tendency, propensity (K.~Popper), amount
of ignorance, subjective uncertainty \cite{saunders} or likelihood,
degree of belief, \etc\ \cite{fine}. But even from philosophical
point of view ``probability is a deeply troublesome notion'' (L.~Hardy
\cite[p.~78]{schloss3}), that is supported by the vast literature on
this subject \cite{szabo+}(!), \cite[pp.~41--43]{sudbery},
\cite[Chs.~3--4]{sklar}, \cite{auletta, accardi, deutsch, hren0,
hren3}; ``philosophy of probability is a scandal''
\cite[p.~550]{saunders}. Pauli, again, recollected the frequent
Einstein's remarks in this regard: ``One can't make a theory out of a
lot of `maybe's' [~$=$ probably] \ldots\ deep down it is wrong, even if
it is empirically and logically right''.

Thus, probability in quantum theory is a statistics. It comes from
statistische Kollektivs \cite{mises} and may only be a shortened
term for the relative ``frequency in long runs'' (von~Neumann). This
is why the conventional tractability of the quantum"=postulates'
mathematics ---calculation of \emph{probabilities} for the
\emph{classical} events to occur in the \emph{`reality'} (what is
that?)---is inadequate neither as a doctrinal point of departure nor
as a `post-math' interpretation. It presents us with a circulus
vitiosus of re"=exegeses. C.~Fuchs, referring to de~Finetti's words
in an interview with Quanta Magazine (2015), prognosticates that
this conception ``will go the way of phlogiston''.

The ultimate conclusion completes remarks~\ref{two} and \ref{seven}.
If we accept the set"=theoretic eye on things then sect.~\ref{inv},
by all appearances, provides a positive answer to the question about
the rigidity of \qm"=theory \cite{colbeck}---``change any one aspect,
and the whole structure collapses'' \cite[p.~1]{aaronson}. See also
the 2-nd epigraph to this section. At least, it is hard to imagine
\emph{what any other} (axiom-free) way of turning empiricism into
quantum mathematics would look like, as soon as we abandon the
minimalistic entity $\statePsi\GOTO{\sss\scr A}\state\alpha$.
