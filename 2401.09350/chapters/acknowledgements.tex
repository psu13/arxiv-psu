I am forever indebted to my dearest colleagues Edo Liberty, Amir Ingber,
Brian Hentschel, and Aditya Krishnan. This incredible but humble group
of scholars at Pinecone are generous with their time and knowledge,
patiently teaching me what I do not know,
and letting me use them as a sounding board without fail.
Their encouragement throughout the process of writing this manuscript,
too, was the force that drove this work to completion.

I am also grateful to Claudio Lucchese, a dear friend, a co-author,
and a professor of computer science at the Ca' Foscari University of Venice, Italy.
I conceived of the idea for this monograph as I lectured at Ca' Foscari
on the topic of retrieval and ranking, upon Claudio's kind invitation.

I would not be writing these words were it not for
the love, encouragement, and wisdom of Franco Maria Nardini,
of the ISTI CNR in Pisa, Italy. In the mad and often maddening world of research,
Franco is the one knowledgeable and kind soul who
restores my faith in research and guides me as I navigate the landscape.

Finally, there are no words that could possibly convey my deepest gratitude
to my partner, Katherine, for always supporting me and my ambitions;
for showing by example what dedication, tenacity, and grit ought to mean;
and for finding me when I am lost.
