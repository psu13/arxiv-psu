	abstract = {A categorical framework for modeling and analyzing systems in a broad sense is proposed. These systems should be thought of as "machines" with inputs and outputs, carrying some sort of signal that occurs through some notion of time. Special cases include discrete, continuous, and hybrid dynamical systems. A central goal is to understand the systems that result from arbitrary interconnection of component subsystems. The fundamental categorical tools used here include lax functors out of monoidal categories, which provide a language of compositionality, as well as sheaf theory, which flexibly captures the crucial notion of time. Continuous- and discrete-time systems are related via functors, and a new sheaf-theoretic perspective on hybrid systems is proposed. A multitude of examples is offered in an appendix.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03501},
	abstract = {Databases have been studied category-theoretically for decades. The database schema---whose purpose is to arrange high-level conceptual entities---is generally modeled as a category or sketch. The data itself, often called an instance, is generally modeled as a set-valued functor, assigning to each conceptual entity a set of examples. While mathematically elegant, these categorical models have typically struggled with representing concrete data such as integers or strings. In the present work, we propose an extension of the set-valued functor model, making use of multisorted algebraic theories (a.k.a. Lawvere theories) to incorporate concrete data in a principled way. This also allows constraints and queries to make use of operations on data, such as multiplication or comparison of numbers, helping to bridge the gap between traditional databases and programming languages. We also show how all of the components of our model---including schemas, instances, change-of-schema functors, and queries - fit into a single double categorical structure called a proarrow equipment (a.k.a. framed bicategory).},

Depending on the choice of monad, the database fields may contain generalized values such as lists or sets of values, or they may contain exceptions such as various types of nulls. The return operation for monads ensures that any ordinary database instance will count as one of these generalized instances, and the bind operation ensures that generalized values behave well under joins of foreign key sequences. Different monads allow for vastly different types of information to be stored in the database. For example, we show that classical concepts like Markov chains, graphs, and finite state automata are each perfectly captured by a different monad on the same schema.},

We show that morphisms of schemas induce three "data migration functors", which translate instances from one schema to the other in canonical ways. These functors parameterize projections, unions, and joins over all tables simultaneously and can be used in place of conjunctive and disjunctive queries. We also show how to connect a database and a functional programming language by introducing a functorial connection between the schema and the category of types for that language.

Each simplex corresponds to a table in the database. There, our main concern was to find a categorical formulation of databases; the simplicial nature of the schemas was to some degree unexpected and unexploited. In the present note, we show how to use this geometric formulation effectively on a computer. If we think of each simplex as a polygonal tile, we can imagine assembling custom databases by mixing and matching tiles. Queries on this database can be performed by drawing paths through the resulting tile formations, selecting records at the start-point of this path and retrieving corresponding records at its end-point.},

This book develops the theory and practice of signal processing systems for these situations that extract useful, qualitative information using the mathematics of topology -- the study of spaces under continuous transformations. Since the collection of continuous transformations is large and varied, tools which are topologically-motivated are automatically insensitive to substantial distortion.

	abstract = {An introduction to category theory as a rigorous, flexible, and coherent modeling language that can be used across the sciences.Category theory was invented in the 1940s to unify and synthesize different areas in mathematics, and it has proven remarkably successful in enabling powerful communication between disparate fields and subfields within mathematics. This book shows that category theory can be useful outside of mathematics as a rigorous, flexible, and coherent modeling language throughout the sciences. Information is inherently dynamic; the same ideas can be organized and reorganized in countless ways, and the ability to translate between such organizational structures is becoming increasingly important in the sciences. Category theory offers a unifying framework for information modeling that can facilitate the translation of knowledge between disciplines.Written in an engaging and straightforward style, and assuming little background in mathematics, the book is rigorous but accessible to non-mathematicians. Using databases as an entry to category theory, it begins with sets and functions, then introduces the reader to notions that are fundamental in mathematics: monoids, groups, orders, and graphs―categories in disguise. After explaining the "big three" concepts of category theory―categories, functors, and natural transformations―the book covers other topics, including limits, colimits, functor categories, sheaves, monads, and operads. The book explains category theory by examples and exercises rather than focusing on theorems and proofs. It includes more than 300 exercises, with solutions. Category Theory for the Sciences is intended to create a bridge between the vast array of mathematical concepts used by mathematicians and the models and frameworks of such scientific disciplines as computation, neuroscience, and physics.},

The book makes available to the inquisitive non-specialist the conceptual transformations and intellectual orientations of modern and contemporary mathematics, and their significance for speculative philosophical thought. The first part of the text discusses the specificity of modern (1830-1950) and contemporary (1950 to the present) mathematics, and offers an extensive review of how philosophy of mathematics addressed it (or failed to). In the second part, thirteen detailed case studies examine the greatest creators in the field, compiling a map of the central advances accomplished in mathematics over the last half-century. Drawing on these concrete examples, the third part proposes some generic outlines for synthesis. Zalamea's book serves as a conceptual introduction to mathematical themes rarely discussed outside specialist circles, and as a critical lens by means of which today's mathematics may aid us in the configuration of new cultural perspectives. If analytic philosophy was forged in the fires of set theory and classical logic at the beginning of the twentieth century, then today, at the dawn of the twenty-first, and around the scaffolding of category theory and the logic of sheaves, it is time for a complementary, synthetic philosophy to be built.},

	abstract = {The twentieth century has witnessed an unprecedented 'crisis in the foundations of mathematics', featuring a world-famous paradox (Russell's Paradox), a challenge to 'classical' mathematics from a world-famous mathematician (the 'mathematical intuitionism' of Brouwer), a new foundational school (Hilbert's Formalism), and the profound incompleteness results of Kurt Gödel. In the same period, the cross-fertilization of mathematics and philosophy resulted in a new sort of 'mathematical philosophy', associated most notably (but in different ways) with Bertrand Russell, W. V. Quine, and Gödel himself, and which remains at the focus of Anglo-Saxon philosophical discussion. The present collection brings together in a convenient form the seminal articles in the philosophy of mathematics by these and other major thinkers. It is a substantially revised version of the edition first published in 1964 and includes a revised bibliography. The volume will be welcomed as a major work of reference at this level in the field.},

First, the introduction is from the locale viewpoint, motivated by the logic of finite observations: this provides a more direct approach than the traditional one based on abstracting properties of open sets in the real line. Second, the author freely exploits the methods of locale theory. Third, there is substantial discussion of some computer science applications. As computer scientists become more aware of the mathematical foundations of their discipline, it is appropriate that such topics are presented in a form of direct relevance and applicability. This book goes some way towards bridging the gap for computer scientists.},

	abstract = {This thesis develops the theory of sheaves and cosheaves with an eye towards applications in science and engineering. To provide a theory that is computable, we focus on a combinatorial version of sheaves and cosheaves called cellular sheaves and cosheaves, which are finite families of vector spaces and maps parametrized by a cell complex. We develop cellular (co)sheaves as a new tool for topological data analysis, network coding and sensor networks. A foundation for multi-dimensional level-set persistent homology is laid via constructible cosheaves, which are equivalent to representations of {MacPherson}'s entrance path category. By proving a van Kampen theorem, we give a direct proof of this equivalence. A cosheaf version of the i'th derived pushforward of the constant sheaf along a definable map is constructed directly as a representation of this category. We go on to clarify the relationship of cellular sheaves to cosheaves by providing a formula that defines a derived equivalence, which in turn recovers Verdier duality. Compactly-supported sheaf cohomology is expressed as the coend with the image of the constant sheaf through this equivalence. The equivalence is further used to establish relations between sheaf cohomology and a herein newly introduced theory of cellular sheaf homology. Inspired to provide fast algorithms for persistence, we prove that the derived category of cellular sheaves over a 1D cell complex is equivalent to a category of graded sheaves. Finally, we introduce the interleaving distance as an extended pseudo-metric on the category of sheaves. We prove that global sections partition the space of sheaves into connected components. We conclude with an investigation into the geometry of the space of constructible sheaves over the real line, which we relate to the bottleneck distance in persistence.},

	abstract = {With this chapter we examine categorial sheaves over the closed sets of a topological space. Aside from the historical interest that sheaves seem to have been defined over closed sets first before the more usual definition over open sets, there are a number of other reasons for developing the theory of sheaves over closed sets. First of all having a base topology of closed sets gives us a working concept of boundary that does not exist for the open set sheaf notion. One area in which this may work for us is the mathematics of physics. Lawvere in the introduction to Categories in Continuum Physics [21] mentions the speculation that there is a role for a closed set sheaf in thermodynamics as a functor from a category of parts of a body to a category of “abstract thermodynamical state-and-process systems” (p.9). Another reason for closed set sheaves is their effect on categorial logic. A closed set topology ordered by set inclusion is a paraconsistent algebra. Via the sheaves we can introduce this paraconsistency to toposes.},

This book is a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to the subject, tracing its development from first principles and examples through many of its most recent advances. Roughly half the book is devoted to a rigorous treatment of the classical theory; the remaining material is an in-depth presentation of topics that appear for the first time in textbook form, including the theory of misère quotients and Berlekamp's generalized temperature theory. Packed with hundreds of examples and exercises and meticulously cross-referenced, Combinatorial Game Theory will appeal equally to students, instructors, and research professionals. More than forty open problems and conjectures are mentioned in the text, highlighting the many mysteries that still remain in this young and exciting field.

Fernando Zalamea (Professor of Mathematics at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia) offers a synthetic perspective on the vast spectrum of contemporary mathematics, together with an analysis of the new philosophical problems originating therein. The book makes available to the inquisitive non-specialist the conceptual transformations and intellectual orientations of modern and contemporary mathematics, and their significance for speculative philosophical thought. The first part of the text discusses the specificity of modern (1830-1950) and contemporary (1950 to the present) mathematics, and offers an extensive review of how philosophy of mathematics addressed it (or failed to). In the second part, thirteen detailed case studies examine the greatest creators in the field, compiling a map of the central advances accomplished in mathematics over the last half-century. Drawing on these concrete examples, the third part proposes some generic outlines for synthesis. Zalamea's book serves as a conceptual introduction to mathematical themes rarely discussed outside specialist circles, and as a critical lens by means of which today's mathematics may aid us in the configuration of new cultural perspectives. If analytic philosophy was forged in the fires of set theory and classical logic at the beginning of the twentieth century, then today, at the dawn of the twenty-first, and around the scaffolding of category theory and the logic of sheaves, it is time for a complementary, synthetic philosophy to be built.},

Over a century of development of principles and techniques in algebraic topology has of late crossed over to a variety of application domains. This text gives a completely novel introduction to these methods in the context of the applications. "Elementary Applied Topology" is short (250 pp. plus bibliography and index) and richly illustrated, with 268 figures. It is perfect for both self-study, and as the basis for a course in applied topology. This book is also well-suited for use as a supplementary text in a more traditional algebraic topology course, providing both context and motivation for the tools to be learned. The progression of mathematical techniques is a fresh approach. The book begins with a quick trip through manifolds and cell complexes. The segue to algebraic topology comes in the form of the Euler characteristic and the Euler calculus born from it. Passing from this to homology, exact sequences, and cohomology sets the stage for the innovative content to come. This is comprised of modern Morse theory (including discrete Morse theory, Conley index, and stratified Morse theory), sheaf theory (with an emphasis on cellular sheaves and cosheaves), and, finally, category theory and categorification. Every tool and topic is paired with an application. These range in scope across the biological, economic, engineering, material, physical, and statistical sciences. Of particular note are the applications to topological data analysis, including persistent homology and barcodes. "Elementary Applied Topology" is the first comprehensive text on applied algebraic topology for students of all mathematical sciences.},

As a filtration, it ought to have persistence properties, since persistence is one source of strong properties for arbitrarily thresholded data. This document should also clarify the compatibility between sheaves as models and assignments as observations beyond the simple (pseudo)metrical quantification provided by consistency radius.},

	abstract = {We use the mathematical language of sheaf theory to give a unified treatment of non-locality and contextuality, in a setting which generalizes the familiar probability tables used in non-locality theory to arbitrary measurement covers; this includes Kochen-Specker configurations and more. We show that contextuality, and non-locality as a special case, correspond exactly to obstructions to the existence of global sections. We describe a linear algebraic approach to computing these obstructions, which allows a systematic treatment of arguments for non-locality and contextuality. We distinguish a proper hierarchy of strengths of no-go theorems, and show that three leading examples --- due to Bell, Hardy, and Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger, respectively --- occupy successively higher levels of this hierarchy. A general correspondence is shown between the existence of local hidden-variable realizations using negative probabilities, and no-signalling; this is based on a result showing that the linear subspaces generated by the non-contextual and no-signalling models, over an arbitrary measurement cover, coincide. Maximal non-locality is generalized to maximal contextuality, and characterized in purely qualitative terms, as the non-existence of global sections in the support. A general setting is developed for Kochen-Specker type results, as generic, model-independent proofs of maximal contextuality, and a new combinatorial condition is given, which generalizes the `parity proofs' commonly found in the literature. We also show how our abstract setting can be represented in quantum mechanics. This leads to a strengthening of the usual no-signalling theorem, which shows that quantum mechanics obeys no-signalling for arbitrary families of commuting observables, not just those represented on different factors of a tensor product.},

	abstract = {There is an interplay between models, specified by variables and equations, and their connections to one another. This dichotomy should be reflected in the abstract as well. Without referring to the models directly -- only that a model consists of spaces and maps between them -- the most readily apparent feature of a multi-model system is its topology. We propose that this topology should be modeled first, and then the spaces and maps of the individual models be specified in accordance with the topology. Axiomatically, this construction leads to sheaves. Sheaf theory provides a toolbox for constructing predictive models described by systems of equations. Sheaves are mathematical objects that manage the combination of bits of local information into a consistent whole. The power of this approach is that complex models can be assembled from smaller, easier-to-construct models. The models discussed in this chapter span the study of continuous dynamical systems, partial differential equations, probabilistic graphical models, and discrete approximations of these models.},

	abstract = {In this unique book, the authors, both only amateur Go players themselves, develop the mathematical techniques for solving late-stage endgame problems that can stump top-ranking professionals. As a typical game of Go approaches its conclusion, the active regions of play become independent of one another, and the overall board position may be regarded as a sum of disconnected partial board positions. Combinatorial game theory, a branch of mathematics Berlekamp helped develop, has long been concerned with such sums of games. Here, it is applied to solving Go-related problems with a bewildering choice of similar-looking moves and subtle priority relationships. The theory presented in this book assigns each active area on the board an abstract value and then shows how to compare them to select the optimum move or add them up to determine the ideal outcome. Some of the values are familiar numbers or fractions, but most are more bizarre objects quite unlike anything in the existing Co literature. From these abstractions, the reader learns that positions seeming ro have the same numerical value can be crucially different while positions that appear completely different can be mathematically identical. A go player with an interest in mathematics or a mathematician interested in Go will not want to miss this book because it describes substantial connections between the two subjects which have been, until now, overlooked.},

Succeeding chapters examine the concept of topos, local set theories, fundamental properties of toposes, sheaves, locale-valued sets, and natural and real numbers in local set theories.

While an individual Chen space can be much worse than a smooth manifold, the category of all Chen spaces is much better behaved than the category of smooth manifolds. For example, any subspace or quotient space of a Chen space is a Chen space, and the space of smooth maps between Chen spaces is again a Chen space. Souriau's "diffeological spaces" share these convenient properties. Here we give a unified treatment of both formalisms. Following ideas of Dubuc, we show that Chen spaces, diffeological spaces, and even simplicial complexes are examples of "concrete sheaves on a concrete site". As a result, the categories of such spaces are locally cartesian closed, with all limits, all colimits, and a weak subobject classifier. For the benefit of differential geometers, our treatment explains most of the category theory we use.},

Whether Gould’s subject is Boulez, Stokowski, Streisand, or his own highly individual thoughts on the performance and creation of music, the reader will be caught up in his intensity, intelligence, passion and devotion. For those who never knew him, this book will be a particular treasure as a companion to his recordings and as the delicious discovery of a new friend.},

In the familiar example of simplicial sets, levels coincide with dimensions and give rise to the usual notions of n-skeletal and n-coskeletal simplicial sets. In addition to the obvious ordering, the levels provide a stricter means of comparing the complexity of objects, which is determined by the answer to the following question posed by Bill Lawvere: when does n-skeletal imply k-coskeletal? This paper, which subsumes earlier unpublished work of some of the authors, answers this question for several toposes of interest to homotopy theory and higher category theory: simplicial sets, cubical sets, and reﬂexive globular sets. For the latter, n-skeletal implies (n + 1)-coskeletal but for the other two examples the situation is considerably more complicated: n-skeletal implies (2n − 1)-coskeletal for simplicial sets and 2n-coskeletal for cubical sets, but nothing stronger. In a discussion of further applications, we prove that n-skeletal cyclic sets are necessarily (2n + 1)-coskeletal.},

He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367–47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias’s relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343–2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip’s death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of “Peripatetics”), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander’s death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322. Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows: I. Practical: Nicomachean Ethics; Great Ethics (Magna Moralia); Eudemian Ethics; Politics; Oeconomica (on the good of the family); Virtues and Vices. {II}. Logical: Categories; On Interpretation; Analytics (Prior and Posterior); On Sophistical Refutations; Topica. {III}. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc. {IV}. Metaphysics: on being as being. V. On Art: Art of Rhetoric and Poetics. {VI}. Other works including the Athenian Constitution; more works also of doubtful authorship. {VII}. Fragments of various works such as dialogues on philosophy and literature; and of treatises on rhetoric, politics and metaphysics. The Loeb Classical Library® edition of Aristotle is in twenty-three volumes.},

The first part of the book traces the scholastic defense of divine infinity from the holocaust of Montsegur up to John Duns Scotus. The second part examines the semiotic breakthrough initiated by William of Ockham and the subsequent penetration of infinist theory into a wide variety of disciplines."},

Spinoza confronts the grand philosophical problems that are still current today: the comparative role of ontology (the theory of substance), of epistemology (the theory of ideas), and of political anthropology (the theory of modes, passions, and actions).The goal of this book is to determine the rapport among the univocity of Being in the theory of substance; the production of truth and the genesis of sense in the theory of ideas; and practical joy (or the elimination of the sad passions) and the selective organization of the passions in the theory of modes.},

	abstract = {"The hard won power ... to assess correctly the continuum of the natural numbers grew out of titanic struggles in the realm of mathematical logic in which Hermann Weyl took a leading part." — John Archibald {WheelerHermann} Weyl (1885–1955) ranks among the most important mathematicians and physicists of this century. Though Weyl was not primarily a philosopher, his wide-ranging philosophical reflections on the formal and empirical sciences remain extremely valuable. Besides indicating clearly which results of classical analysis are invalidated by an important family of "non-circular" (predicative) theories, The Continuum wrestles with the problem of applying constructive mathematical models to cases of concrete physical and perceptual continuity. This new English edition features a personal reminiscence of Weyl written by John Archibald Wheeler.Originally published in German in 1918, the book consists of two chapters. Chapter One, entitled Set and Function, deals with property, relation and existence, the principles of the combination of judgments, logical inference, natural numbers, iteration of the mathematical process, and other topics. The main ideas are developed in this chapter in such a way that it forms a self-contained whole.In Chapter Two, The Concept of Numbers \& The Continuum, Weyl systematically begins the construction of analysis and carries through its initial stages, taking up such matters as natural numbers and cardinalities, fractions and rational numbers, real numbers, continuous functions, curves and surfaces, and more.Written with Weyl's characteristic passion, lucidity, and wisdom, this advanced-level volume is a mathematical and philosophical landmark that will be welcomed by mathematicians, physicists, philosophers, and anyone interested in foundational analysis.},

	abstract = {Category theory has foundational importance because it provides conceptual lenses to characterize what is important and universal in mathematics—with adjunctions being the primary lense. If adjunctions are so important in mathematics, then perhaps they will isolate concepts of some importance in the empirical sciences. But the applications of adjunctions have been hampered by an overly restrictive formulation that avoids heteromorphisms or hets. By reformulating an adjunction using hets, it is split into two parts, a left and a right semiadjunction (or half-adjunuction). Semiadjunctions (essentially a formulation of a universal mapping property using hets) turn out to be the appropriate concept for applications in the life sciences. The semiadjunctions characterize three principal schemes with applications: 1. determination through a receiving universal (e.g., natural selection, perception, language acquisition, recursion, and language understanding); 2. determination through a sending universal (e.g., intentional action, {DNA} mechanism to build amino acids, hierarchy of regulatory genes to build organs, stem cells, and language production), and 3. two-way determination with one universal as both receiving and sending (e.g., perception/action and language understanding/production).},

	abstract = {1. This paper shows how the universals of category theory in mathematics provide a model (in the Platonic Heaven of mathematics) for the self-predicative strand of Plato's Theory of Forms as well as for the idea of a "concrete universal" in Hegel and similar ideas of paradigmatic exemplars in ordinary thought. 2. The paper also shows how the always-self-predicative universals of category theory provide the "opposite bookend" to the never-self-predicative universals of iterative set theory and thus that the paradoxes arose from having one theory (e.g., Frege's Paradise) where universals could be either self-predicative or non-self-predicative (instead of being always one or the other). 3. Moreover the paper considers one of the most important examples of self-predicative universals in pure mathematics, namely adjoint functors or adjunctions. It gives a parsing of adjunctions into two halves (left and right semi-adjunctions) using the heterodox notion of heteromorphisms, and then shows that the parts can be recombined in a new way to define the cognate-to-adjoints notion of a brain functor that provides an abstract conceptual model of a brain. 4. Finally the paper argues that at least one way category theory has foundational relevance is that it isolates the universal concepts and structures that are important throughout mathematics.},

In this book, basic calculus, together with some of its applications to simple physical problems, are presented through the use of a straightforward, rigorous, axiomatically formulated concept of "zero-square", or "nilpotent" infinitesimal–that is, a quantity so small that its square and all higher powers can be set, literally, to zero. As the author shows, the systematic employment of these infinitesimals reduces the differential calculus to simple algebra and, at the same time, restores to use the "infinitesimal" methods figuring in traditional applications of the calculus to physical problems–a number of which are discussed in this book. The text also contains a historical and philosophical introduction, a chapter describing the logical features of the infinitesimal framework, and an Appendix sketching the developments in the mathematical discipline of category theory that have made the refounding of infinitesimals possible.},

The focus on compact operators on a Hilbert space includes the Bernstein-Robinson theorem on invariant subspaces, which was first proved with nonstandard methods. Ever mindful of the needs of readers with little background in these subjects, the text offers a straightforward treatment that provides a strong foundation for advanced studies of analysis},

	shorttitle = {From Frege to Godel},
	abstract = {The fundamental texts of the great classical period in modern logic, some of them never before available in English translation, are here gathered together for the first time. Modern logic, heralded by Leibniz, may be said to have been initiated by Boole, De Morgan, and Jevons, but it was the publication in 1879 of Gottlob Frege's Begriffsschrift that opened a great epoch in the history of logic by presenting, in full-fledged form, the propositional calculus and quantification theory.Frege's book, translated in its entirety, begins the present volume. The emergence of two new fields, set theory and foundations of mathematics, on the borders of logic, mathematics, and philosophy, is depicted by the texts that follow. Peano and Dedekind illustrate the trend that led to Principia Mathematica. Burali-Forti, Cantor, Russell, Richard, and König mark the appearance of the modern paradoxes. Hilbert, Russell, and Zermelo show various ways of overcoming these paradoxes and initiate, respectively, proof theory, the theory of types, and axiomatic set theory. Skolem generalizes Löwenheim's theorem, and heand Fraenkel amend Zermelo's axiomatization of set theory, while von Neumann offers a somewhat different system. The controversy between Hubert and Brouwer during the twenties is presented in papers of theirs and in others by Weyl, Bernays, Ackermann, and Kolmogorov. The volume concludes with papers by Herbrand and by Gödel, including the latter's famous incompleteness paper.Of the forty-five contributions here collected all but five are presented in extenso. Those not originally written in English have been translated with exemplary care and exactness; the translators are themselves mathematical logicians as well as skilled interpreters of sometimes obscure texts. Each paper is introduced by a note that sets it in perspective, explains its importance, and points out difficulties in interpretation. Editorial comments and footnotes are interpolated where needed, and an extensive bibliography is included.},

One of the towering intellectual figures of his age, Scotus has had a lasting influence on Western philosophy comparable only to that of Thomas Aquinas. The questions Scotus discusses on the subject "God and Creatures" were originally presented to him in the course of a quodlibetal dispute, a public debate popular in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. In revising the questions for publication, Scotus wove in much of his basic philosophy and theology, making this work one of the mainstays on which his reputation as a thinker depends. The text of the English translation is based on the most authoritative version of the original Latin text. The extensive annotation and a glossary of technical terms permit each question to be read as an integral treatise in its own right. Originally published in 1975.

	title = {Category Theory for the Sciences},
	isbn = {978-0-262-02813-4},
	abstract = {Category theory was invented in the 1940s to unify and synthesize different areas in mathematics, and it has proven remarkably successful in enabling powerful communication between disparate fields and subfields within mathematics. This book shows that category theory can be useful outside of mathematics as a rigorous, flexible, and coherent modeling language throughout the sciences. Information is inherently dynamic; the same ideas can be organized and reorganized in countless ways, and the ability to translate between such organizational structures is becoming increasingly important in the sciences. Category theory offers a unifying framework for information modeling that can facilitate the translation of knowledge between disciplines. Written in an engaging and straightforward style, and assuming little background in mathematics, the book is rigorous but accessible to non-mathematicians. Using databases as an entry to category theory, it begins with sets and functions, then introduces the reader to notions that are fundamental in mathematics: monoids, groups, orders, and graphs – categories in disguise. After explaining the "big three" concepts of category theory – categories, functors, and natural transformations – the book covers other topics, including limits, colimits, functor categories, sheaves, monads, and operads. The book explains category theory by examples and exercises rather than focusing on theorems and proofs. It includes more than 300 exercises, with solutions. Category Theory for the Sciences is intended to create a bridge between the vast array of mathematical concepts used by mathematicians and the models and frameworks of such scientific disciplines as computation, neuroscience, and physics.},

No other question has ever moved so profoundly the spirit of man; no other idea has so fruitfully stimulated his intellect; yet no other concept stands in greater need of clarification than that of the infinite." - David Hilbert This interdisciplinary study of infinity explores the concept through the prism of mathematics and then offers more expansive investigations in areas beyond mathematical boundaries to reflect the broader, deeper implications of infinity for human intellectual thought. More than a dozen world‐renowned researchers in the fields of mathematics, physics, cosmology, philosophy, and theology offer a rich intellectual exchange among various current viewpoints, rather than displaying a static picture of accepted views on infinity. The book starts with a historical examination of the transformation of infinity from a philosophical and theological study to one dominated by mathematics. It then offers technical discussions on the understanding of mathematical infinity. Following this, the book considers the perspectives of physics and cosmology: Can infinity be found in the real universe? Finally, the book returns to questions of philosophical and theological aspects of infinity.},

	shorttitle = {Aristotle},
	abstract = {Aristotle, great Greek philosopher, researcher, reasoner, and writer, born at Stagirus in 384 {BCE}, was the son of Nicomachus, a physician, and Phaestis. He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367–47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias’s relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343–2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip’s death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of “Peripatetics”), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander’s death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322. Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows: I. Practical: Nicomachean Ethics; Great Ethics (Magna Moralia); Eudemian Ethics; Politics; Oeconomica (on the good of the family); Virtues and Vices. {II}. Logical: Categories; On Interpretation; Analytics (Prior and Posterior); On Sophistical Refutations; Topica. {III}. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc. {IV}. Metaphysics: on being as being. V. On Art: Art of Rhetoric and Poetics. {VI}. Other works including the Athenian Constitution; more works also of doubtful authorship. {VII}. Fragments of various works such as dialogues on philosophy and literature; and of treatises on rhetoric, politics and metaphysics. The Loeb Classical Library® edition of Aristotle is in twenty-three volumes.},

Oresme proposes original solutions to most of these topics, based on an original view concerning the relationship between substance and its properties ("condicio/condiciones, modi rerum"); Oresme s solutions are always associated with sharp criticism of the two main philosophical schools: the realists (Walter Burley) and the nominalist (William Ockham).This commentary is a very valuable record of the philosophical discussions at Paris in the midst of 1the 4th Century."},

	abstract = {Categories for the Working Mathematician provides an array of general ideas useful in a wide variety of fields. Starting from the foundations, this book illuminates the concepts of category, functor, natural transformation, and duality. The book then turns to adjoint functors, which provide a description of universal constructions, an analysis of the representations of functors by sets of morphisms, and a means of manipulating direct and inverse limits. These categorical concepts are extensively illustrated in the remaining chapters, which include many applications of the basic existence theorem for adjoint functors. The categories of algebraic systems are constructed from certain adjoint-like data and characterized by Beck's theorem. After considering a variety of applications, the book continues with the construction and exploitation of Kan extensions. This second edition includes a number of revisions and additions, including two new chapters on topics of active interest. One is on symmetric monoidal categories and braided monoidal categories and the coherence theorems for them. The second describes 2-categories and the higher dimensional categories which have recently come into prominence. The bibliography has also been expanded to cover some of the many other recent advances concerning categories.},

It was first published in 1952, some twenty years after the publication of Gödel's paper on the incompleteness of arithmetic, which marked, if not the beginning of modern logic, at least a turning point after which “nothing was ever the same.” Kleene was an important figure in logic, and lived a long full life of scholarship and teaching. The 1930s was a time of creativity and ferment in the subject, when the notion of “computable” moved from the realm of philosophical speculation to the realm of science. This was accomplished by the work of Kurt Göde1, Alan Turing, and Alonzo Church, who gave three apparently different precise definitions of “computable”. When they all turned out to be equivalent, there was a collective realization that this was indeed the “right notion”. Kleene played a key role in this process. One could say that he was “there at the beginning” of modern logic. He showed the equivalence of lambda calculus with Turing machines and with Gödel's recursion equations, and developed the modern machinery of partial recursive functions. This textbook played an invaluable part in educating the logicians of the present. It played an important role in their own logical education.},

	shorttitle = {Causality},
	abstract = {Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. The book will open the way for including causal analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and economics. Students in these fields will find natural models, simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.},

Unlike the Five Ways of Thomas Aquinas or Anselm's famous Proslogion argument, Scotus's proof is of another order of complexity and amounts to a little "summa" of his metaphysics. Among those theologians to accept Aristotle's scientific theory, Scotus is perhaps the first to realize fully its negative consequences if the philosophical doctrines of divine illumination and the analogical concept of being interact. His treatment of the God-question is distinguished for its deliberatively holistic approach to what was conventionally a series of unrelated topics.},

@book{program_homotopy_2013,
	title = {Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics},
	shorttitle = {Homotopy Type Theory},
	abstract = {Homotopy type theory is a new branch of mathematics that combines aspects of several different fields in a surprising way. It is based on a recently discovered connection between homotopy theory and type theory. It touches on topics as seemingly distant as the homotopy groups of spheres, the algorithms for type checking, and the definition of weak \${\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textbackslash}backslashinfty\$-groupoids. Homotopy type theory brings new ideas into the very foundation of mathematics. On the one hand, there is Voevodsky's subtle and beautiful univalence axiom. The univalence axiom implies, in particular, that isomorphic structures can be identified, a principle that mathematicians have been happily using on workdays, despite its incompatibility with the "official" doctrines of conventional foundations. On the other hand, we have higher inductive types, which provide direct, logical descriptions of some of the basic spaces and constructions of homotopy theory: spheres, cylinders, truncations, localizations, etc. Both ideas are impossible to capture directly in classical set-theoretic foundations, but when combined in homotopy type theory, they permit an entirely new kind of "logic of homotopy types". This suggests a new conception of foundations of mathematics, with intrinsic homotopical content, an "invariant" conception of the objects of mathematics - and convenient machine implementations, which can serve as a practical aid tothe working mathematician. This is the Univalent Foundations program. The present book is intended as a first systematic exposition of the basics of univalent foundations, and a collection of examples of this new style of reasoning - but without requiring the reader to know or learn any formal logic, or to use any computer proof assistant. We believe that univalent foundations will eventually become a viable alternative to set theory as the "implicit foundation" for the unformalized mathematics done by most mathematicians.},

	abstract = {The Critical Nexus confronts an important and vexing enigma of early writings on music: why chant, which was understood to be divinely inspired, needed to be altered in order to work within the then-operative modal system. To unravel this mystery, Charles Atkinson creates a broad framework that moves from Greek harmonic theory to the various stages in the transmission of Roman chant, citing numerous music treatises from the sixth to the twelfth century. Out of this examination emerges the central point behind the problem: the tone-system advocated by writers coming from the Greek harmonic tradition was not suited to the notation of chant and that this basic incompatibility led to the creation of new theoretical constructs. By tracing the path of subsequent adaptation at the nexus of tone-system, mode, and notation, Atkinson promises new and far-reaching insights into what mode meant to the medieval musician and how the system responded to its inherent limitations. Through a detailed examination of the major musical treatises from the sixth through the twelfth centuries, this text establishes a central dichotomy between classical harmonic theory and the practices of the Christian church. Atkinson builds the foundation for a broad and original reinterpretation of the modal system and how it relates to melody, grammar, and notation. This book will be of interest to all musicologists, music theorists working on mode, early music specialists, chant scholars, and medievalists interested in music.},

In Higher Topos Theory, Jacob Lurie presents the foundations of this theory, using the language of weak Kan complexes introduced by Boardman and Vogt, and shows how existing theorems in algebraic topology can be reformulated and generalized in the theory's new language. The result is a powerful theory with applications in many areas of mathematics. The book's first five chapters give an exposition of the theory of infinity-categories that emphasizes their role as a generalization of ordinary categories. Many of the fundamental ideas from classical category theory are generalized to the infinity-categorical setting, such as limits and colimits, adjoint functors, ind-objects and pro-objects, locally accessible and presentable categories, Grothendieck fibrations, presheaves, and Yoneda's lemma. A sixth chapter presents an infinity-categorical version of the theory of Grothendieck topoi, introducing the notion of an infinity-topos, an infinity-category that resembles the infinity-category of topological spaces in the sense that it satisfies certain axioms that codify some of the basic principles of algebraic topology. A seventh and final chapter presents applications that illustrate connections between the theory of higher topoi and ideas from classical topology.},

Thanks to Sachs's superb guidance, the Physics comes alive as a profound dialectical inquiry whose insights into the enduring questions about nature, cause, change, time, and the 'infinite' are still pertinent today. Using such guided studies in class has been exhilarating both for myself and my students."––Leon R. Kass, The Committee on Social Thought, University of Chicago Aristotle’s Physics is the only complete and coherent book we have from the ancient world in which a thinker of the first rank seeks to say something about nature as a whole. For centuries, Aristotle’s inquiry into the causes and conditions of motion and rest dominated science and philosophy. To understand the intellectual assumptions of a powerful world view—and the roots of the Scientific Revolution—reading Aristotle is critical. Yet existing translations of Aristotle’s Physics have made it difficult to understand either Aristotle’s originality or the lasting value of his work.In this volume in the Masterworks of Discovery series, Joe Sachs provides a new plain-spoken English translation of all of Aristotle’s classic treatise and accompanies it with a long interpretive introduction, a running explication of the text, and a helpful glossary. He succeeds brilliantly in fulfilling the aim of this innovative series: to give the general reader the tools to read and understand a masterwork of scientific discovery.},

This work is accompanied by Spinoza's later correspondence, much of which responds to criticism of the Theological-Political Treatise. The volume also includes his last work, the unfinished Political Treatise, which builds on the foundations of the Theological-Political Treatise to offer plans for the organization of nontyrannical monarchies and aristocracies. The elaborate editorial apparatus–including prefaces, notes, glossary, and indexes–assists the reader in understanding one of the world's most fascinating, but also most difficult, philosophers.

He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367–47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias’s relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343–2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip’s death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of “Peripatetics”), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander’s death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322. Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows: I. Practical: Nicomachean Ethics; Great Ethics (Magna Moralia); Eudemian Ethics; Politics; Oeconomica (on the good of the family); Virtues and Vices. {II}. Logical: Categories; On Interpretation; Analytics (Prior and Posterior); On Sophistical Refutations; Topica. {III}.

Category theory organizes mathematics using morphisms that transmit structure and determination. Structures of mathematical interest are usually characterized by some universal mapping property so the general thesis is that category theory is about determination through universals. In recent decades, the notion of adjoint functors has moved to center-stage as category theory's primary tool to characterize what is important and universal in mathematics. Hence our focus here is to present a theory of adjoint functors, a theory which shows that all adjunctions arise from the birepresentations of "chimeras" or "heteromorphisms" between the objects of different categories. Since representations provide universal mapping properties, this theory places adjoints within the framework of determination through universals. The conclusion considers some unreasonably effective analogies between these mathematical concepts and some central philosophical themes.},

In the discussion of motions the base line (longitudo) is the time, while the perpendiculars raised on the base line (latitudines) represent the velocity from instant to instant in the motion. Thus uniform acceleration is represented by a right triangle. Oresme even extended his definition to include three-dimensional figures.

Thirteenth and fourteenth century Christian Aristotelians thought the answer had to be "transubstantiation." Acclaimed philosopher, Marilyn {McCord} Adams, investigates these later medieval theories of the Eucharist, concentrating on the writings of Thomas Aquinas, Giles of Rome, Duns Scotus, and William Ockham, with some reference to Peter Lombard, Hugh of St. Victor, and Bonaventure. She examines how their efforts to formulate and integrate this theological datum provoked them to make significant revisions in Aristotelian philosophical theories regarding the metaphysical structure and location of bodies, differences between substance and accidents, causality and causal powers, and fundamental types of change. Setting these developments in the theological context that gave rise to the question draws attention to their understandings of the sacraments and their purpose, as well as to their understandings of the nature and destiny of human beings. Adams concludes that their philosophical modifications were mostly not ad hoc, but systematic revisions that made room for transubstantiation while allowing Aristotle still to describe what normally and naturally happens. By contrast, their picture of the world as it will be (after the last judgment) seems less well integrated with their sacramental theology and their understandings of human nature.},

The volume begins with excerpts from Leibniz's Paris writings, in which he tackles such problems as whether the infinite division of matter entails "perfect points", whether matter and space can be regarded as true wholes, whether motion is truly continuous, and the nature of body and substance. Comprising the second section is Pacidius Philalethi, Leibniz's brilliant dialogue of late 1676 on the problem of the continuity of motion. In the selections of the final section, from his Hanover writings of 1677-1686, Leibniz abandons his earlier transcreationism and atomism in favour of the theory of corporeal substance, where the reality of body and motion is founded in substantial form or force. Leibniz's texts (one in French, the rest in Latin) are presented with facing-page English translations, together with an introduction, notes, appendixes containing related excerpts from earlier works by Leibniz and his predecessors, and a valuable glossary detailing important terms and their translations.},

	abstract = {This is an accessible introduction to the life and thought of John Duns Scotus (c. 1266–1308), the scholastic philosopher and theologian who came to be called the Subtle Doctor. A native of Scotland (as his name implies), Scotus became a Franciscan and taught in Oxford, Paris, and Cologne. In his writings he put Aristotelian thought to the service of Christian theology and was the founder of a school of scholasticism called Scotism, which was often opposed to the Thomism of the followers of Thomas Aquinas. In particular, Scotus is well known for his defense of contra-causal free will and logical possibility and for his account of individuation in terms of "haecceity" or "thisness." Cross offers a clear introductory account of the most significant aspects of Scotus's theological thought. Theology is here construed broadly to include Scotus's philosophical investigation of God's existence and attributes. In addition to providing a clear, though not always uncritical, outline of Scotus's positions, Cross aims to show how Scotus's theories fit into modern debates, particularly contemporary debates in philosophical theology, and to point out Scotus's historical significance in the development of theology.},

By defining numbers as the strengths of positions in certain games, the author arrives at a new class, the surreal numbers, that includes both real numbers and ordinal numbers. These surreal numbers are applied in the author's mathematical analysis of game strategies. The additions to the Second Edition present recent developments in the area of mathematical game theory, with a concentration on surreal numbers and the additive theory of partizan games.},

The author, a well-known philosopher and historian of mathematics, first examines Euclid, who is considered the father of the axiomatic method, before moving onto Hilbert and Lawvere. He then presents a deep textual analysis of each writer and describes how their ideas are different and even how their ideas progressed over time. Next, the book explores category theory and details how it has revolutionized the notion of the axiomatic method. It considers the question of identity/equality in mathematics as well as examines the received theories of mathematical structuralism. In the end, Rodin presents a hypothetical New Axiomatic Method, which establishes closer relationships between mathematics and physics.Lawvere's axiomatization of topos theory and Voevodsky's axiomatization of higher homotopy theory exemplify a new way of axiomatic theory building, which goes beyond the classical Hilbert-style Axiomatic Method. The new notion of Axiomatic Method that emerges in categorical logic opens new possibilities for using this method in physics and other natural sciences.This volume offers readers a coherent look at the past, present and anticipated future of the Axiomatic Method.},

The rich music of this period, by composers such as Guillaume de Machaut and Francesco Landini, is not only beautiful, but also rewards deep study and analysis. Yet contradictions and gaps abound in the ars nova of the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries-how do we read this music? how do we perform this music? what was the cultural context of these performances? These problems are well met by the ingenuity of approaches and solutions found by scholars in this volume. The twenty-seven articles brought together reflect the broad methodological and chronological range of scholarly inquiry on the ars nova.},

The Posterior Analytics contains the first extensive treatment of the nature and structure of science in the history of philosophy, and {McKirahan}'s aim is to interpret it sympathetically, following the lead of the text, rather than imposing contemporary frameworks on it. In addition to treating the theory as a whole, the author uses textual and philological as well as philosophical material to interpret many important but difficult individual passages. A number of issues left obscure by the Aristotelian material are settled by reference to Euclid's geometrical practice in the Elements. To justify this use of Euclid, {McKirahan} makes a comparative analysis of fundamental features of Euclidian geometry with the corresponding elements of Aristotle's theory. Emerging from that discussion is a more precise and more complex picture of the relation between Aristotle's theory and Greek mathematics--a picture of mutual, rather than one-way, dependence.Originally published in 1992.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

Later chapters look to the "Metaphysics" to understand how the unity of definitions guarantees their certainty, and to the "Topics" to discover why definitions must be formulated in terms of the genus and differentia(e) of the object defined.

	abstract = {In his discussion of the four causes, Aristotle claims that ‘the hypotheses are material causes of the conclusion’ (Physics 2. 3, Metaphysics Δ 2). This claim has puzzled commentators since antiquity. It is usually taken to mean that the premisses of any deduction are material causes of the conclusion. By contrast, I argue that the claim does not apply to deductions in general but only to scientific demonstrations. For Aristotle, the theorems of a given science are composites consisting of the indemonstrable premisses from which they are demonstrated. Accordingly, these premisses are elements, and hence material causes, of the theorems. In this way, Aristotle’s claim can be shown to be well-motivated and illuminating.},

	abstract = {Aristotle, great Greek philosopher, researcher, reasoner, and writer, born at Stagirus in 384 {BCE}, was the son of Nicomachus, a physician, and Phaestis. He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367–47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias’s relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343–2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip’s death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of “Peripatetics”), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander’s death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322.Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows:I. Practical: Nicomachean Ethics; Great Ethics (Magna Moralia); Eudemian Ethics; Politics; Oeconomica (on the good of the family); Virtues and Vices.{II}. Logical: Categories; On Interpretation; Analytics (Prior and Posterior); On Sophistical Refutations; Topica.{III}. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc.{IV}. Metaphysics: on being as being.V. On Art: Art of Rhetoric and Poetics.{VI}. Other works including the Athenian Constitution; more works also of doubtful authorship.{VII}. Fragments of various works such as dialogues on philosophy and literature; and of treatises on rhetoric, politics and metaphysics.The Loeb Classical Library® edition of Aristotle is in twenty-three volumes.},

Not only did Descartes providethe first distinctly modern formulation of laws of nature and aconservation principle of motion, but he also constructed what wouldbecome the most popular theory of planetary motion of the lateseventeenth century. As the renowned historian of science {CliffordTruesdell} has observed, “[Descartes’ physics] is the beginningof theory in the modern sense” (Truesdell 1984, 6). Yet, for allof the forward-looking, seemingly modern, aspects of Descartes’physics, many of Descartes’ physical hypotheses bear a close kinshipwith the Aristotelian-influenced science of late-Medieval {andRenaissance} Scholasticism. It is this unique amalgam of both old andnew concepts of the physical world that may account for the currentrevival of scholarly interest in Descartes’ physics.},

The causes and consequences of environmental change can, of course, be measured at different levels and along multiple scales. While the natural sciences have long understood the importance of scale, research regarding scale in the social sciences has been less explicit, less precise, and more variable. The growing need for interdisciplinary work across the natural/social science divide, however, demands that each achieve some common understandings about scaling issues. This survey seeks to facilitate the dialogue between natural and social scientists by reviewing some of the more important aspects of the concept of scale employed in the social sciences, especially as they relate to the human dimensions of global environmental change. The survey presents the fundamentals of scale, examines four general scaling issues typical of social science, and explores how different social science disciplines have used scale in their research.},

Is the concept of an infinitesimally small quantity even logically coherent?

	abstract = {Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914) was an American philosopher, physicist, mathematician, and the founder of pragmatism. Despite his importance in the history of philosophy, a unified statement of his thought has been unavailable. With this publication, readers at long last are offered the philosopher's only known, complete, and coherent account of his own work. Originally delivered as the Cambridge Conferences Lectures of 1898, Reasoning and the Logic of Things is the most accessible and thorough introduction to Peirce's mature thought to be found within the compass of a single book. Beginning with an explanation of the nature of philosophy, Peirce proceeds to illustrate his claim that mathematics provides the foundation of our logic and metaphysics. We find here the clearest formulation of an idea present in Peirce's thought since the 1860s, the distinction between three kinds of reasoning: induction, deduction, and retroduction. Then follows an introduction to Peirce's chief logical doctrines, as well as his attempts to provide a classification of the sciences, a theory of categories, and a theory of science. In conclusion, turning from "reasoning" to the "logic of things," Peirce called for an evolutionary cosmology to explain the reality of laws and described the kinds of reasoning he employed in developing this cosmology. At the urging of his friend William James, Peirce made an uncharacteristic effort in these lectures to present his ideas in terms intelligible to a general audience--those without advanced training in logic and philosophy. The introductory materials by Kenneth Ketner and Hilary Putman add to the volume's lucidity. Consequently, this book will be a valuable source for readers outside of the circle of Peirce specialists.},

"Our aim," the authors write, "is to bring to the inquisitive reader. . .an explanation of the many ways the word 'number' is used." They explore patterns that emerge in arithmetic, algebra, and geometry, describe these pattern' relevance both inside and outside mathematics, and introduce the strange worlds of complex, transcendental, and surreal numbers.

All science aims, eventually, at getting nearer to an answer. Then he turns us to the current conception of matter and shows how profoundly it is modifying philosophy as it drives men to recognize that Form, not Substance, is the fundamental; and that, because of limitations, adequacy rather than truth is the most that we can ask for in our mental 'models'. He drives home the difficulty for the human mind of recognizing the impossibility (which modern physics foreshows) of continuity of observation. The principle of causality is based upon it; but physics now shows that the continuity so long assumed can never be confirmed by observations. Thus he brings his reader to the problem of free will, and our conviction that we have the power, though physics cannot say we have it, of acting by choice, of being causers not merely 'causes'. Schrodinger's mastery of the knowledge he deals with, his clear and logical (yet lively) way of wrinting, his humanity, and his just sense of the importance of the ideas he discusses, make this book of great and controversial interest. It is as simple as it can be, and yet is is difficult. Read it and think.  It is addressed to all.},

The mechanism underlying this perception of continuity has intrigued many researchers and has been well documented in both the visual and auditory modalities. The present study shows for the first time to our knowledge that an illusion of continuity also occurs with vibrotactile stimulation. We found that when the brief temporal gaps inserted into a vibrotactile target were filled with vibrotactile noise, the target vibration was perceived to continue through the noise if the target vibration was sufficiently weak relative to the noise. It is important that the illusory continuity of the vibration cannot be distinguished from the physically continuous vibration. These results therefore suggest that the continuity illusion is common to multiple sensory modalities and that it reflects a fundamental principle of perception.

Much confusion has arisen in the past through a neglect of the develop ment of Leibniz's ideas, and Couturat's impressive plea, in his edition of the Opuscu/es et fragments (p. xii), for such an arrangement is valid even for incomplete editions. The beginning student will do well, however, to read the maturer writings of Parts {II}, {III}, and {IV} first, leaving Part I, from a period too largely neglected by Leibniz criticism, for a later study of the still obscure sources and motives of his thought. The Introduction aims primarily to provide cultural orientation and an exposition of the structure and the underlying assumptions of the philosophical system rather than a critical evaluation.

The purpose of the Linz Seminar, since its inception, was and is to foster the development of the mathematical aspects of fuzzy sets. In the earlier years, this was accomplished by bringing together for a week small grou ps of mathematicians in various fields in an intimate, focused environment which promoted much informal, critical discussion in addition to formal presentations. Beginning with the tenth Seminar, the intimate setting was retained, but each Seminar narrowed in theme; and participation was broadened to include both younger scholars within, and established mathematicians outside, the mathematical mainstream of fuzzy sets theory. Most of the material of this book was developed over the years in close association with the Seminar or influenced by what transpired at Linz. For much of the content, it played a crucial role in either stimulating this material or in providing feedback and the necessary screening of ideas. Thus we may fairly say that the book, and the eleventh Seminar to which it is directly related, are in many respects a culmination of the previous Seminars.},

Time can be discrete or continuous, linear or branching, and distribution is allowed over space as well as time. Concepts from category theory help to achieve this generality: objects are modeled by sheaves; inheritance by sheaf morphisms; systems by diagrams; and interconnections by diagrams of diagrams. In addition, behaviour is given by limit, and the result of interconnection by colimit. The approach is illustrated with many examples, including a semantics for a simple concurrent object-based programming language.},

Coxon's full critical edition of the extant remains of Parmenides of Elea-the fifth-century B.C. philosopher by many considered \&quote;one of the greatest and most astonishing thinkers of all times.\&quote; (Karl Popper) Coxon's presentation of the complete ancient evidence for Parmenides and his comprehensive examination of the fragments, unsurpassed to this day, have proven invaluable to our understanding of the Eleatic since the book's first publication in 1986. This edition, edited by Richard {McKirahan} and with a new preface by Malcolm Schofield, is released on the 100th anniversary of Coxon's birth. This new edition for the first time includes English translations of the testimonia and of any Ancient Greek throughout the book, as well as an English/Greek glossary by Richard {McKirahan}, and revisions by the late author himself. The text consists of Coxon's collations of the relevant folios of manuscripts of Sextus Empiricus, Proclus and Simplicius and includes all extant fragments, a commentary, the testimonia, a complete list of sources, linguistic parallels from both earlier and later authors, and the fullest critical apparatus that has appeared since Diels' Poetarum Philosophorum Fragmenta (1901). The collection of testimonia includes the philosophical discussions of Parmenides by Plato, Aristotle and the Neoplatonists, most of which had been omitted by Diels. The introduction discusses the history of the text, the language and form of the poem, Parmenides' use and understanding of the verb 'to be', his place in the history of earlier and later philosophy and the biographical tradition. In the commentary Coxon deals in detail with both the language and the subject matter of the poem and pays full attention to Parmenides' account of the physical world. The appendix relates later Eleatic arguments to those of Parmenides.},

For the first time, this book uses categorical algebra to build such a foundation, starting from intuitive descriptions of mathematically and physically common phenomena and advancing to a precise specification of the nature of Categories of Sets. Set theory as the algebra of mappings is introduced and developed as a unifying basis for advanced mathematical subjects such as algebra, geometry, analysis, and combinatorics. The formal study evolves from general axioms that express universal properties of sums, products, mapping sets, and natural number recursion.},

We show that the pertinent frame completion is obtained as sheaﬁﬁcation of the presheaves on the given meet-semilattice with respect to its canonical Grothendieck topology, an explicit description of which is easily given. Our conclusion is that there is an intrinsic categorical quality to the notion of “disjunction” in the context of property lattices of physical systems.},

	series = {Applied Logic Series},
	abstract = {Since antiquity two different negations in natural languages have been noted: predicate negation (‘not honest’) and predicate term negation (‘dishonest’). Aristotle tried to formalize them in his system of oppositions, distinguishing between affirmation and negation (‘honest’ and ‘not honest’) and contraries (‘honest’ and ‘dishonest’). The Stoics replaced Aristotle’s logic of terms by their logic of propositions. Although they considered three types of negation, none of them corresponded to Aristotle’s predicate term negation. Frege and modern logic have followed the Stoics in either identifying predicate term negation with predicate negation or in casting predicate term negation out of logic into the realm of pragmatics. Although an extensive literature has arisen on these issues, we have not found mathematical models. We propose category-theoretic models with two distinct negation operations, neither of them in general Boolean. We study combinations of the two (‘not dishonest’) and sentential counterparts of each. We touch briefly on quantifiers and modalities. The models are based on an analysis of aspects. For instance, to give an overall, global judgement of John’s honesty we must agree on what aspects of John are relevant for that judgement: John qua person (global aspect), John qua social being (social aspect), John qua family man, John qua professional man, etc. We conceptualize this ‘Aristotelian’ analysis by means of a category of ‘aspects’. A model (for the negations) is obtained from the category of presheaves on this category. Although neither of the negations is Boolean, predicate negation turns out to be Boolean at the ‘global’ aspect (the aspect of the overall judgement) which may help to explain the persistent belief that logic is naturally Boolean.},
