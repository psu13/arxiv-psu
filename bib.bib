	Abstract = {Abstract A century after the discovery of quantum mechanics, the meaning of quantum mechanics still remains elusive. This is largely due to the puzzling nature of the wave function, the central object in quantum mechanics. If we are realists about quantum mechanics, how should we understand the wave function? What does it represent? What is its physical meaning? Answering these questions would improve our understanding of what it means to be a realist about quantum mechanics. In this survey article, I review and compare several realist interpretations of the wave function. They fall into three categories: ontological interpretations, nomological interpretations, and the sui generis interpretation. For simplicity, I will focus on non-relativistic quantum mechanics.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the relationship between the synthetic approach to topology, in which every set is equipped with an intrinsic topology, and constructive theory of metric spaces. We relate the synthetic notion of compactness of Cantor space to Brouwer's Fan Principle. We show that the intrinsic and metric topologies of complete separable metric spaces coincide if they do so for Baire space. In Russian Constructivism the match between synthetic and metric topology breaks down, as even a very simple complete totally bounded space fails to be compact, and its topology is strictly finer than the metric topology. In contrast, in Brouwer's intuitionism synthetic and metric notions of topology and compactness agree.},

	Abstract = {In physics, Feynman diagrams are used to reason about quantum processes. In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these diagrams is a powerful analogy between quantum physics and topology. Namely, a linear operator behaves very much like a ``cobordism'': a manifold representing spacetime, going between two manifolds representing space. This led to a burst of work on topological quantum field theory and ``quantum topology''. But this was just the beginning: similar diagrams can be used to reason about logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where they represent programs. With the rise of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became clear that there is extensive network of analogies between physics, topology, logic and computation. In this expository paper, we make some of these analogies precise using the concept of ``closed symmetric monoidal category''. We assume no prior knowledge of category theory, proof theory or computer science.},

	Abstract = {The notion of a natural model of type theory is defined in terms of that of a representable natural transfomation of presheaves. It is shown that such models agree exactly with the concept of a category with families in the sense of Dybjer, which can be regarded as an algebraic formulation of type theory. We determine conditions for such models to satisfy the inference rules for dependent sums...], dependent products...]and intensional identity types , as used in homotopy type theory. It is then shown that a category admits such a model if it has a class of maps that behave like the abstract fibrations in axiomatic homotopy theory: They should be stable under pullback, closed under composition and relative products, and there should be weakly orthogonal factorizations into the class. It follows that many familiar settings for homotopy theory also admit natural models of the basic system of homotopy type theory.},

	Abstract = {This essay provides a short introduction to the ideas and potential implications of quantum physics for scholars in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. Quantum-inspired ideas pepper current discourse in all of these fields, in ways that range from playful metaphors to sweeping ontological claims. We explain several of the most important concepts at the core of quantum theory, carefully delineating the scope and bounds of currently established science, in order to aid the evaluation of such claims. In particular, we emphasize that the smallest units of matter and light, as described in quantum physics, are not things, meaning that they do not obey the logic we take for granted when discussing the behavior of macroscopic objects. We also highlight the substantial debate that exists within physics about the interpretation of the equations and empirical results at the core of quantum physics, noting that implicit (and contested) philosophical commitments necessarily accompany any discussion of quantum ideas that takes place in non-technical language.},

@article{Mohrhoff2017,
	Abstract = {Although the present paper looks upon the formal apparatus of quantum mechanics as a calculus of correlations, it goes beyond a purely operationalist interpretation. Having established the consistency of the correlations with the existence of their correlata (measurement outcomes), and having justified the distinction between a domain in which outcome-indicating events occur and a domain whose properties only exist if their existence is indicated by such events, it explains the difference between the two domains as essentially the difference between the manifested world and its manifestation. A single, intrinsically undifferentiated Being manifests the macroworld by entering into reflexive spatial relations. This atemporal process implies a new kind of causality and sheds new light on the mysterious nonlocality of quantum mechanics. Unlike other realist interpretations, which proceed from an evolving-states formulation, the present interpretation proceeds from Feynman's formulation of the theory, and it introduces a new interpretive principle, replacing the collapse postulate and the eigenvalue--eigenstate link of evolving-states formulations. Applied to alternatives involving distinctions between regions of space, this principle implies that the spatiotemporal differentiation of the physical world is incomplete. Applied to alternatives involving distinctions between things, it warrants the claim that, intrinsically, all fundamental particles are identical in the strong sense of numerical identical. They are the aforementioned intrinsically undifferentiated Being, which manifests the macroworld by entering into reflexive spatial relations.},

@article{Dieks2017,
	Abstract = {According to what has become a standard history of quantum mechanics, in 1932 von Neumann persuaded the physics community that hidden variables are impossible as a matter of principle, after which leading proponents of the Copenhagen interpretation put the situation to good use by arguing that the completeness of quantum mechanics was undeniable. This state of affairs lasted, so the story continues, until Bell in 1966 exposed von Neumann's proof as obviously wrong. The realization that von Neumann's proof was fallacious then rehabilitated hidden variables and made serious foundational research possible again. It is often added in recent accounts that von Neumann's error had been spotted almost immediately by Grete Hermann, but that her discovery was of no effect due to the dominant Copenhagen Zeitgeist. We shall attempt to tell a story that is more historically accurate and less ideologically charged. Most importantly, von Neumann never claimed to have shown the impossibility of hidden variables tout court, but argued that hidden-variable theories must possess a structure that deviates fundamentally from that of quantum mechanics. Both Hermann and Bell appear to have missed this point; moreover, both raised unjustified technical objections to the proof. Von Neumann's argument was basically that hidden-variables schemes must violate the ``quantum principle'' that physical quantities are to be represented by operators in a Hilbert space. As a consequence, hidden-variables schemes, though possible in principle, necessarily exhibit a certain kind of contextuality. As we shall illustrate, early reactions to Bohm's theory are in agreement with this account. Leading physicists pointed out that Bohm's theory has the strange feature that pre-existing particle properties do not generally reveal themselves in measurements, in accordance with von Neumann's result. They did not conclude that the ``impossible was done'' and that von Neumann had been shown wrong.},

@book{Barrett2012,
	Abstract = {Hugh Everett III was an American physicist best known for his many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, which formed the basis of his PhD thesis at Princeton University in 1957. Although counterintuitive, Everett's revolutionary formulation of quantum mechanics offers the most direct solution to the infamous quantum measurement problem--that is, how and why the singular world of our experience emerges from the multiplicities of alternatives available in the quantum world. The many-worlds interpretation postulates the existence of multiple universes. Whenever a measurement-like interaction occurs, the universe branches into relative states, one for each possible outcome of the measurement, and the world in which we find ourselves is but one of these many, but equally real, possibilities. Everett's challenge to the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics was met with scorn from Niels Bohr and other leading physicists, and Everett subsequently abandoned academia to conduct military operations research. Today, however, Everett's formulation of quantum mechanics is widely recognized as one of the most controversial but promising physical theories of the last century.In this book, Jeffrey Barrett and Peter Byrne present the long and short versions of Everett's thesis along with a collection of his explanatory writings and correspondence. These primary source documents, many of them newly discovered and most unpublished until now, reveal how Everett's thinking evolved from his days as a graduate student to his untimely death in 1982. This definitive volume also features Barrett and Byrne's introductory essays, notes, and commentary that put Everett's extraordinary theory into historical and scientific perspective and discuss the puzzles that still remain.},

	Abstract = {Although the philosophical literature on the foundations of quantum field theory recognizes the importance of Haag's theorem, it does not provide a clear discussion of the meaning of this theorem. The goal of this paper is to make up for this deficit. In particular, it aims to set out the implications of Haag's theorem for scattering theory, the interaction picture, the use of non-Fock representations in describing interacting fields, and the choice among the plethora of the unitarily inequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations for free and interacting fields.},

	Abstract = {The standard presentation of the principles of quantum mechanics is critically reviewed both from the experimental/operational point and with respect to the request of mathematical consistency and logical economy. A simpler and more physically motivated formulation is discussed. The existence of non commuting observables, which characterizes quantum mechanics with respect to classical mechanics, is related to operationally testable complementarity relations, rather than to uncertainty relations. The drawbacks of Dirac argument for canonical quantization are avoided by a more geometrical approach.},

It is the general linear, Markovian, form which ensures that the density matrix is Hermitian, trace 1, positive and completely positive. Some elementary examples of the Lindblad equation are given. The derivation of the Lindblad equation presented here is `simple' in that all it uses is the expression of a Hermitian matrix in terms of its orthonormal eigenvectors and real eigenvalues. Thus, it is appropriate for students who have learned the algebra of quantum theory. Where helpful, arguments are first given in a two-dimensional Hilbert space.},

@article{Cotrufo:2019,
	Abstract = {Confining light in open structures is a long-sought goal in nanophotonics and cavity quantum electrodynamics. Embedded eigenstates provide infinite lifetime despite the presence of available leakage channels, but in linear time-invariant systems they cannot be excited from the outside, due to reciprocity. Here, we investigate how atomic nonlinearities may support single-photon embedded eigenstates, which can be populated by a multi-photon excitation followed by internal relaxation. We calculate the system dynamics and show that photon trapping, as well as the reverse release process, can be achieved with arbitrarily high efficiencies. We also discuss the impact of loss, and a path toward the experimental verification of these concepts.},

	Abstract = {Arguments on controversial points concerning quantum measurement theory and the quantum Zeno effect are presented. In particular it is argued that (1) the quantum Zeno effect is a genuine result of quantum theory and current quantum measurement theory, independent of the projection postulate; (2) the effect is of very general nature and rests on analogous arguments to those involved in Bell's theories; (3) the term ``quantum Zeno effect'' may usefully be restricted to experiments where a measuring device exerts a nonlocal negative-result effect on a microscopic system, mere inhibition of a transition by a directly interacting device not qualifying; (4) since no decay is truly exponential, theoretically all decay phenomena should exhibit the quantum Zeno effect under observation, continuous or discrete. A detailed study is made of the experiments claiming to demonstrate the effect; it is found that they do not meet our criterion above.},

While distinctly non-Newtonian, Bohmian mechanics is a fully deterministic theory of particles in motion, a motion choreographed by the wave function. We find that a Bohmian universe, though deterministic, evolves in such a manner that anappearance of randomness emerges, precisely as described by the quantum formalism and given, for example, by ``$\rho$ = {\textbrokenbar}$\psi${\textbrokenbar}2''. A crucial ingredient in our analysis of the origin of this randomness is the notion of the effective wave function of a subsystem, a notion of interest in its own right and of relevance to any discussion of quantum theory. When the quantum formalism is regarded as arising in this way, the paradoxes and perplexities so often associated with (nonrelativistic) quantum theory simply evaporate.},

@article{Boughn2013,
	Abstract = {The quantum theory of measurement has been a matter of debate for over eighty years. Mostof the discussion has focused on theoretical issues with the consequence that otheraspects (such as the operational prescriptions that are an integral part of experimentalphysics) have been largely ignored. This has undoubtedly exacerbated attempts to find asolution to the ``measurement problem''. How the measurement problem is defined depends tosome extent on how the theoretical concepts introduced by the theory are interpreted. Inthis paper, we fully embrace the minimalist statistical (ensemble) interpretation ofquantum mechanics espoused by Einstein, Ballentine, and others. According to thisinterpretation, the quantum state description applies only to a statistical ensemble ofsimilarly prepared systems rather than representing an individual system. Thus, thestatistical interpretation obviates the need to entertain reduction of the state vector,one of the primary dilemmas of the measurement problem. The other major aspect of themeasurement problem, the necessity of describing measurements in terms of classicalconcepts that lay outside of quantum theory, remains. A consistent formalism forinteracting quantum and classical systems, like the one based on ensembles onconfiguration space that we refer to in this paper, might seem to eliminate this facet ofthe measurement problem; however, we argue that the ultimate interface with experiments isdescribed by operational prescriptions and not in terms of the concepts of classicaltheory. There is no doubt that attempts to address the measurement problem have yieldedimportant advances in fundamental physics; however, it is also very clear that themeasurement problem is still far from being resolved. The pedestrian approach presentedhere suggests that this state of affairs is in part the result of searching for atheoretical/mathematical solution to what is fundamentally an experimental/observationalquestion. It suggests also that the measurement problem is, in some sense, ill-posed andmight never be resolved. This point of view is tenable so long as one is willing to viewphysical theories as providing models of nature rather than complete descriptions of reality. Among other things, these considerations lead us to suggest thatthe Copenhagen interpretation's insistence on the classicality of the measurementapparatus should be replaced by the requirement that a measurement, which is specifiedoperationally, should simply be of sufficient precision.},

	Abstract = {Forty years after the advent of quantum mechanics the problem of hidden variables, that is, the possibility of imbedding quantum theory into a classical theory, remains a controversial and obscure subject. Whereas to most physicists the possibility of a classical reinterpretation of quantum mechanics remains remote and perhaps irrelevant to current problems, a minority have kept the issue alive throughout this period. (See Freistadt [5] for a review of the problem and a comprehensive bibliography up to 1957.) As far as results are concerned there are on the one hand purported proofs of the non-existence of hidden variables, most notably von Neumann's proof, and on the other, various attempts to introduce hidden variables such as de Broglie [4] and Bohm [1] and [2]. One of the difficulties in evaluating these contradictory results is that no exact mathematical criterion is given to enable one to judge the degree of success of these proposals.},

Using a thin-wall bubble approximation for the nucleation process, which is possible when generic quantum gravity corrections are added to the Higgs potential, we show that primordial black holes can stimulate vacuum decay. We demonstrate that for suitable parameter ranges, the vacuum decay process dominates over the Hawking evaporation process. Finally, we comment on the application of these results to vacuum decay seeded by black holes produced in particle collisions.},

@inbook{Milonni1980,
	Abstract = {Quantum theory developed from the study of the interaction of light and matter. Around the beginning of this century, experimental physicists reported phenomena that demonstrated the inadequacy of classical physics. Quantum features of the electromagnetic field were first postulated by Planck in 1900 in order to account for the spectrum of blackbody radiation observed by Lummer and Pringsheim. In order to account for the discrete sequence of wavelengths in the spectrum of atomic hydrogen, Bohr in 1913 postulated that the electron could move only in certain stationary orbits; Planck's constant appeared in his theory as the fundamental ``unit of action.'' We are all familiar with these and other inspired guesses which led finally to the birth of quantum mechanics, as we know it, in the years 1925--26. Dirac's paper on the quantum theory of the electromagnetic field appeared in 1927,(1) and by 1930 there was little doubt that the quantum theory of light and matter was vastly superior to classical theory. Born was so impressed by the theory that at the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927 he remarked, ``We consider that quantum mechanics is a complete theory, and that its fundamental hypotheses, both physical and mathematical, are not susceptible to further modification.''},

	Abstract = {In order to elucidate the properties currently attributed to ideal measurements, one must explain how the concept of an individual event with a well-defined outcome may emerge from quantum theory which deals with statistical ensembles, and how different runs issued from the same initial state may end up with different final states. This so-called ``measurement problem'' is tackled with two guidelines. On the one hand, the dynamics of the macroscopic apparatus A coupled to the tested system S is described mathematically within a standard quantum formalism, where ``q-probabilities'' remain devoid of interpretation. On the other hand, interpretative principles, aimed to be minimal, are introduced to account for the expected features of ideal measurements. Most of the five principles stated here, which relate the quantum formalism to physical reality, are straightforward and refer to macroscopic variables. The process can be identified with a relaxation of S + A to thermodynamic equilibrium, not only for a large ensemble E of runs but even for its sub-ensembles. The different mechanisms of quantum statistical dynamics that ensure these types of relaxation are exhibited, and the required properties of the Hamiltonian of S + A are indicated. The additional theoretical information provided by the study of sub-ensembles remove Schr{\"{o}}dinger's quantum ambiguity of the final density operator for E which hinders its direct interpretation, and bring out a commutative behaviour of the pointer observable at the final time. The latter property supports the introduction of a last interpretative principle, needed to switch from the statistical ensembles and sub-ensembles described by quantum theory to individual experimental events. It amounts to identify some formal ``q-probabilities'' with ordinary frequencies, but only those which refer to the final indications of the pointer. The desired properties of ideal measurements, in particular the uniqueness of the result for each individual run of the ensemble and von Neumann's reduction, are thereby recovered with economic interpretations. The status of Born's rule involving both A and S is re-evaluated, and contextuality of quantum measurements is made obvious.},

	Abstract = {The apparent dichotomy between quantum jumps on the one hand, and continuous time evolution according to wave equations on the other hand, provided a challenge to Bohr's proposal of quantum jumps in atoms. Furthermore, Schr{\"{o}}dinger's time-dependent equation also seemed to require a modification of the explanation for the origin of line spectra due to the apparent possibility of superpositions of energy eigenstates for different energy levels. Indeed, Schr{\"{o}}dinger himself proposed a quantum beat mechanism for the generation of discrete line spectra from superpositions of eigenstates with different energies. However, these issues between old quantum theory and Schr{\"{o}}dinger's wave mechanics were correctly resolved only after the development and full implementation of photon quantization. The second quantized scattering matrix formalism reconciles quantum jumps with continuous time evolution through the identification of quantum jumps with transitions between different sectors of Fock space. The continuous evolution of quantum states is then recognized as a sum over continually evolving jump amplitudes between different sectors in Fock space. In today's terminology, this suggests that linear combinations of scattering matrix elements are epistemic sums over ontic states. Insights from the resolution of the dichotomy between quantum jumps and continuous time evolution therefore hold important lessons for modern research both on interpretations of quantum mechanics and on the foundations of quantum computing. They demonstrate that discussions of interpretations of quantum theory necessarily need to take into account field quantization. They also demonstrate the limitations of the role of wave equations in quantum theory, and caution us that superpositions of quantum states for the formation of qubits may be more limited than usually expected.},

	Abstract = {This chapter discusses the relationship between classical and quantum mechanics. Some remarkable insights of the past few decades have drawn wide attention to the importance of the problem of interpreting quantum mechanics, and in particular of explaining classical physics from it. The chapter emphasizes on the Bohr's correspondence principle concerned with the properties of radiation, rather than with the mechanical orbits themselves. The relationship between consistent histories and decoherence is peculiar: on one hand, decoherence is a natural mechanism through which appropriate sets of histories become (approximately) consistent, but on the other hand these approaches appear to have different points of departure. Bohr's brilliant model of the atom reinforced the idea that quantum theory was a theory of quanta. This model simultaneously highlights the clash between classical and quantum physics and carries the germ of a resolution of this conflict through Bohr's equally brilliant correspondence principle. Considerable progress has been made in the task of identifying at least some (approximately) consistent sets that display (approximate) classical behavior. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.
