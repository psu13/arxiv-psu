\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
  We construct a topos in which the Dedekind reals are countable.

  To accomplish this, we first define a new kind of toposes that we call \emph{parameterized realizability toposes}. They are built from partial combinatory algebras whose application operation depends on a parameter, and in which realizers operate uniformly with respect to a given parameter set.

  Our topos is the parameterized realizability topos whose realizers are oracle-computable partial maps, with oracles serving as parameters and ranging over the representations of a non-diagonalizable sequence, discovered by Joseph Miller. It is a sequence of reals in $[0,1]$ that is non-diagonalizable in the sense that any real in $[0,1]$ that is oracle-computable, uniformly in oracles representing the sequence, must already appear in the sequence.
  %
  The Dedekind reals are countable in the topos because the non-diagonalizable sequence appears in it as an epimorphism.

  The topos is intuitionistic, as it invalidates both the law of excluded middle and the axiom of countable choice. The Cauchy reals are uncountable. The Hilbert cube is countable, from which Brouwer's fixed-point theorem follows as an easy corollary of Lawvere's fixed-point theorem. From the 1-dimensional Brouwer's fixed-point theorem we obtain the intermediate value theorem and the lesser limited principle of omniscience. The Kreisel-Lacombe-Shoenfield-Tseitin theorem stating that all real-valued maps are continuous is valid, because the usual proof is uniform with respect to oracles.
  %
  Lastly, the closed interval $[0,1]$, being countable, can trivially be covered by a sequence of open intervals whose lengths add up to any prescribed $0 < \epsilon < 1$, and such a cover has no finite subcover.
  However, we show that any sequence of open intervals with rational endpoints covering $[0,1]$ must has a finite subcover.
