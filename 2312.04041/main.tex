\noindent \textsc{``Astronomy and Astrophysics (and more generally Science) provides an amazing opportunity for discovery, excitement, learning, creativity and fostering a passion in a particular (or many!) topic(s). However, it can feel overwhelming or challenging at some points and all of us have gone through this. But always remember that you absolutely deserve to be here and you have already made the hardest step by taking the very first steps towards cultivating your passion and building your foundation for a career (either in astronomy or in another field entirely!). Continue that passion, motivation, and persistence no matter what you do, and surround yourself with people who provide a welcoming and supportive environment and that lift you up and support you unequivocally in your journey. If you don't have someone locally, try to find your people, as I know there are so many of us that want to see your star shine brighter and brighter. We can't wait to see what you will do next!''}

There will be ups and downs in your pursuit of your goals and dreams -- please really celebrate your achievements and also use them to remind yourself that you can do it when you are struggling. If you ever find that you are doubting yourself, please remind yourself how far you've come and that we are all cheering you on.''}

My advice to you is to have confidence in yourself and your abilities, even when you don’t feel that way on the inside. You are strong and capable, and, with perseverance, you can tackle any problem. It has been said that you should \textsl{fake it until you make it}; instead, try faking it until you become it.''}

\noindent \textsc{``My advice is to follow your genuine interests and don’t be discouraged by what other people may say or think. You will follow your interests passionately, and others will see it too and help you. You may not know everything or enough about a subject, but passion will help you to learn and fill the gaps. Keep your curiosity alive, and not only in your primary field. Often, ideas come when learning about something absolutely different. And don’t be afraid to challenge yourself. It may feel scary and very uncomfortable, yet this is the only way to learn and grow. You’ll get used to the feeling of being outside your comfort zone, but only with regular practice.''}\\

With these in mind, I would offer guidance to those who may be searching: (i) trust your instincts (while remaining considerate of others), (ii) resist the allure of conformity, especially when things get tough, and (iii) understand that it's okay to change directions once in a while.''}\\

\noindent \textsc{``In my experience, the best way to combat imposter syndrome is to read more than everyone else -- read the textbook chapters before class, read as many papers as you can on your research topic. Nervousness when channeled into motivation to really know your stuff is actually productive. Ask a million questions; approach everything in this wild ride as an opportunity to learn. \\

There may be really, really bad moments. They may suck a lot. You will get through them. Learn from them to become tougher, wiser, and more empathetic. We are rooting for you! Discovering new things about space is hard, it's also THE COOLEST THING EVER. Try to take a few minutes every once in a while to be in awe of our remarkable universe.''}

\\
Another piece of advice is that you should not follow the advice you receive, and instead you should shape your future the way you like.''}

\\
\\
It is important to have multiple people who you can confide in or ask questions. Sometimes your most important mentors will be peers or people who are just one year ahead of you! Lastly, once a mentor, always a mentor -- it's ok to reach out even if you don't talk every week!''}

No one knows better than you what your qualities are. I also want to pass on one of the best pieces of advice I've ever received; \textsl{Some you win, some you lose, but if you let those get to you, you never get anywhere}. Whatever you want from life, chances are you won't get it straight away, but don't give up too easily. Try, try twice, try three times. And if route A doesn't work, try route B, and otherwise route C.''}
