\@doendnote{endnote53}{In general one can choose $\protect \mathcal  {Z}_{0}$ and $\protect \mathcal  {Z}^{A}_{0}$ as partition functions of any quadratic Hamiltonian. It amounts to redefine the reference Hamiltonian around which one performs the interaction expansion. A particular useful example is to expand around a mean-field Hamiltonian and the resulting $\Delta S_{n}$ will be the entanglement entropy difference to a mean-field state. Employing this trick will further improve efficiency of our algorithm, especially in the long-range-ordered phase. We thank Fakher Assaad for pointing this out to us.}
