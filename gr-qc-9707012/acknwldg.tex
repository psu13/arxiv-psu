\section*{Acknowledgements}

These notes were written to accompany a course taught in
Part III of the Cambridge University Mathematical Tripos. 
There are occasional references to questions on four 'example sheets', which can be found in the Appendix.
The writing of these course notes has greatly benefitted from 
discussions with Gary Gibbons and Stephen Hawking. The organisation of the 
course was based on unpublished notes of Gary Gibbons and owes much to the
1972 Les Houches and 1986 Carg{\' e}se lecture notes of Brandon Carter, and to
the 1972 lecture notes of Stephen Hawking. Finally, I am very grateful to 
Tim Perkins for typing the notes in \LaTeX, producing the diagrams, and putting
it all together.
