\subsection{Lepton colliders and the physics of the Higgs boson}

\subsubsection{Generalities about $\ee$ colliders}

The $\ee$ collision \cite{ee-basics-review} is a very simple reaction, with a
well defined initial state and rather simple topologies in the final state. It
has a favorable signal to background ratio, leading to a very clean
experimental environment which allows to easily search for new phenomena and to
perform very high--precision studies as has been shown at PEP/PETRA/TRISTAN and
more recently at SLC and LEP.  In particular, the  high--precision studies of 
the properties of the $Z$ boson at LEP1 and SLC, and the determination of the
properties of the $W$ boson at LEP2,  have laid a very solid base for the
Standard Model as was discussed in \S1.\s

The physical processes in $\ee$ collisions are in general mediated by
$s$--channel photon [for charged particles] and $Z$ boson exchanges with cross
sections which scale as the inverse of the center of mass energy squared,
$\sigma \propto 1/s$, and $t$--channel gauge boson or electron/neutrino
exchange, with cross sections which may rise like $\log(s)$. In these
$t$--channel processes, only particles which couple directly to the electron
are involved at lowest order.  The $s$--channel exchange is the most
interesting process when it takes place: it is democratic, in the sense that it
gives approximately the same rates for weakly and strongly interacting matter
particles, and for the production of known and new particles, when the energy
is high enough.\s

However, in this channel, the rates are low at high energies and one needs to
increase the luminosity to compensate for the $1/s$ drop of the interesting
cross sections. At $\sqrt{s} \sim 1$ TeV, a luminosity ${\cal L}\sim 10^{34}$ 
cm$^{-2}\,$s$^{-1}$ is required, which for a run time of $10^7$s a year leads
to an integrated luminosity  of $\int {\cal L} \sim 100$ fb$^{-1}$ per year, to
produce $10^4$ muon pairs as at PEP and PETRA. Such a luminosity is necessary
to allow for thorough data analyses, including cuts on the event samples and
allowing for acceptance losses in the detectors. At higher energies, the
luminosity should be scaled as $s$ to generate the same number of events.\s

Because of synchrotron radiation which rises as the fourth power of the c.m. 
energy in circular machines, $\ee$ colliders beyond LEP2 must be linear
machines \cite{Technology-choice}, a type of accelerator which has been
pioneered by the SLC.  Various reference designs of future high--energy $\ee$
colliders in the TeV range are being studied in Europe (TESLA \cite{TESLAtdr}
at DESY and CLIC \cite{CLICtdr} at CERN), the United States (NLC \cite{NLCtdr})
and in Japan (JLC \cite{JLCtdr}). Two technologies have been proposed for the
next linear collider with center of mass energies up to $\sqrt{s}=1$ TeV: one
based on superconducting acceleration modules at moderate frequency, and
another based on  warm acceleration structures operating at high radio
frequencies.  A third and rather new approach is based on a two--beam scheme
where high current and low energy beams create the acceleration field for the
high--energy electron--positron beams. The technology for this collider, which
could reach c.m. energies in the multi--TeV range after presumably some halts
at intermediate energies, is still to be proved. \s

To achieve the  large luminosities which are targeted at  these machines, many
technological challenges need to be overcome. For instance, the beams have to
be focused to extremely small dimensions near the interaction point and very
high  acceleration gradients are needed to reach center of mass energies in the
TeV range. In the case of the TESLA machine, for which a Technical Design
Report  is already available, the main parameters of the beams  are summarized
in Table 4.1. In the case of the JLC and NLC machines, the designs have been
worked out in detail and are documented in a zeroth order  Technical Design
Report. The two--beam acceleration scheme is being followed at CERN and it is
hoped that before the end of this decade, the technical concept can be proved; 
this multi--TeV collider is thus expected to be a next generation machine. \s

For details on the future machines and on the issues related to the foreseen
and planned detectors, we refer the reader to Refs.~\cite{eeReviews,Rolf-para}. 
In the following, we briefly list a few important physics points about 
these future linear $\ee$ colliders  \cite{TESLA,LC-Notes,NLC,JLC,CLIC}: \s 

$\bullet$ One should have the possibility to adjust the c.m. energy of the 
colliders in order to make detailed studies and, for instance, to maximize the 
cross section for Higgs  boson production in some particular channels or scan 
the threshold for $W$ boson and top quark pair production, or for some newly 
produced particles. \s

$\bullet$ The requirement of a high--luminosity is achieved by squeezing the
electrons and positrons into bunches of very small transverse size, leading to
beamstrahlung which results into beam energy loss and the smearing of the
initially sharp $\ee$ c.m. energy. Since the precise knowledge of the initial
state energy is very important for precision studies [in particular in some
channels where one would need missing mass techniques], beamstrahlung should be
reduced to a very low level, as is already the case in narrow  beam designs.
\s

$\bullet$ The longitudinal polarization of the electron [and, to a lesser
extent, positron] beam should be easy to obtain as has already been shown at
the SLC. Degrees of polarization of the order of 80--90\% and 40--50\% for,
respectively, the electron and positron beams are expected. The longitudinal
polarization might be important when it comes to make very precise measurements
of the properties of Higgs bosons and to suppress some large backgrounds [in
particular from $W$ bosons] to its production signals \cite{LC-polarization}. \s

$\bullet$ By building a bypass for the transport of the electron and positron
bunches, for instance, very high luminosities can also be obtained at energies
in the range of 100 GeV. Operating on the $Z$ boson resonance, $10^{9}$ $Z$
bosons can be produced, a sample which is two orders of magnitude larger than
the one obtained at LEP1. This GigaZ machine, in particular since longitudinal
polarization will be available, could significantly improve the precision tests
of the SM which have been performed in the previous decade \cite{LC-GigaZ}. \s

$\bullet$ Last but not least, the linear collider can run in three additional
modes. First, one just needs to replace the positron bunches by electron
bunches to have an $e^- e^-$ collider. Then, by illuminating the initial lepton
bunches by laser photons, one can convert the original collider into an $e
\gamma$ or $\gamma \gamma$ collider, with a  comparable total center of mass
energy and luminosity as the initial lepton collider
\cite{gamma-machine1,gamma-machine2}. Higgs particles can be produced as
$s$--channel resonance  at $\gamma \gamma$ colliders
\cite{gamma-Rev-old,gamma-Rev-TESLA,gamma-Rev-NLC,gamma-Jose} and this mode
will be very useful to address problems such as the Higgs boson couplings to
photons and its CP properties. These options, will be also considered in this
chapter. \s


Very recently, the International Technology Recommendation Panel has
recommended \cite{Technology-choice} that the next linear $e^+e^-$ machine,
which should and hopefully will be a joint project, the International Linear
Collider (ILC), is based on superconducting radio--frequency cavities. The
machine should, in a first step, run at energies between $\sqrt{s}=200$ and 500
GeV with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb$^{-1}$ in the four first years,
have the possibility of 80\% polarized electron beams and two interaction
regions with easy switching.  In a second phase, the machine should run at an
energy of $\sqrt{s}=1$ TeV with an integrated luminosity of 1 ab$^{-1}$ in four
years. As options, the panel recommended that the machine should possibly run
in the $e^- e^-$ mode, have 50\% positron polarization, the possiblity to
operate near the $M_Z$ and $2M_W$ thresholds, and  the possibility to run in
the $e\gamma$ and $\gamma \gamma$ modes. \s

In our study of the physics of the Higgs boson at $\ee$ linear colliders, we
will assume for the numerical analyses three values for the c.m. energy,
$\sqrt{s}=0.5, 1$ and 3 TeV which will correspond to the two phases discussed
above and to the subsequent CLIC phase, and an integrated luminosity ${\cal L}
\sim 500$ fb$^{-1}$.  We will also consider briefly the GigaZ option and in
some detail the option of turning the machine into to a $\gam$ collider, the
particularities of which are summarized in the following subsection. Finally,
future muon colliders will be discussed in the last section of this chapter. 

\subsubsection{The photon colliders}

The Compton scattering of laser photons with energies $\omega_0$ in the eV
range with high--energy electrons, $E_e \sim {\cal O}(100~{\rm GeV})$, leads to
a tight bunch of back--scattered high--energy photons
\cite{gamma-machine1,gamma-machine2}. The kinematics of the process is governed
by the dimensionless parameter $x =4 \omega_0 E_e/ m_e^2$.  The fraction of
energy carried by the back--scattered photon, $y=\omega/E_e$, is maximal for
$y_{\rm max}= x/(1+x)$. The highest energy, compared to the $e^-$ beam energy
is therefore obtained for very large values of the parameter $x$. However, to
prevent the creation of $\ee$ pairs in the annihilation of the laser and
scattered photons, one demands that  $x \lsim x_0=4.83$. For this value, the
photon collider can have as much as $\sim 80$\% of the  energy of the original
$\ee$ collider. The scattering angle of the obtained photons is given by
$\theta(y) \simeq m_e( 1+x)/E_e \times \sqrt{y_{\rm max}/y-1}$ and is of the
order of a few micro--radians. \s

The energy spectrum of the back--scattered photon
\beq
f_c (y)= \sigma_c^{-1} \, {\rm d} \sigma_c (y)/ {\rm d}y
\eeq
depends on the product of the  the mean helicity of the initial electron 
$\lambda_e$ and on the degree of circular polarization of the laser photon
$P_\gamma$ with $ -1 \leq 2 \lambda_e P_\gamma \leq +1$. It is defined by 
the differential Compton cross section \cite{gamma-machine2}
 \beq
\frac{d\sigma_c}{dy}  = \frac{\pi\alpha^2}{x m_e^2} [f_0 + 2\lambda_e P_\gamma 
f_1 + 2\lambda_e P_{\gamma '} f_2 + P_\gamma P_{\gamma '} f_3]
\eeq
where the dependence on the polarization of the back--scattered photon 
$P_{\gamma'}$ has been retained. In terms of the variable $r=y/[x(1-y)]$, the 
functions  $f_i \ (i=0,..,3)$ read
\beq
f_0 = \frac{1}{1-y} + 1-y - 4r(1-r) \;, \quad f_1 = xr (1-2r)(2-y) \non\\
f_2 = xr \bigg[ 1+(1-y)(1-2r)^2\bigg] \;, \quad f_3 = (1-2r) \bigg[ \frac{1}
{1-y}+1-y \bigg]
\eeq
When the polarization of the scattered photon is discarded, the integrated 
Compton cross section can be cast into the form 
\beq
&& \hspace*{2cm} \sigma_c= \sigma_c^{\rm np} + 2\lambda_e P_\gamma
\sigma_c^{\rm p} \non \\ 
\sigma_c^{\rm np} &=& \frac{\pi\alpha^2}{x m_e^2} \Bigg[ \frac{1}{2} + 
\frac{8}{x} -\frac{1}{2(1+x)^2} + \bigg( 1-\frac{4}{x}-\frac{8}{x^2} 
\bigg) \ln (x+1) \Bigg] \non \\
\sigma_c^{\rm p} &=& \frac{\pi\alpha^2}{x m_e^2} \Bigg[ -\frac{5}{2} + 
\frac{1}{x+1} - \frac{1}{2(x+1)^2} + \bigg(1+\frac{2}{x}\bigg) 
\ln (x+1) \Bigg]
\eeq
By selecting a given polarization of the initial $e^-$ and laser beams, one 
can have different shapes for the energy distribution of the scattered photons:
a flat distribution if the electron and the laser have the same polarization, 
or an almost  monochromatic  distribution peaked at $y_{\rm max}$ if they have 
opposite polarization. The latter scenario if of course very interesting. \s

Because of the small scattering angle $\theta$ of the photons, the luminosity
of the spectrum depends on the the conversion distance, i.e. the distance
between the intersecting point of the laser and the electron beam and the
interaction point, as well as on the size and shape of the electron beam.  A
geometrical factor $\rho= b \theta/a$ takes into account the non--zero
conversion distance $b$ and the radius $a$ of the assumed round electron beam
[typically, the sizes are $a \sim {\cal O}(10^2~{\rm nm})$ and $b \sim {\cal
O}(1~{\rm cm})]$. If $\rho$ is much larger than unity, only the photons with
high energy can meet at the interaction point, while for $\rho \ll 1$,  photons
with various energies collide and give a rather broad spectrum. \s

When the Compton backscattered photons, that we will denote by $\gamma_1$ and 
$\gamma_2$, are taken as initial states, the cross section for the process
$\gamma \gamma \to X$  with polarized photons reads
\beq
{\rm d}\hat{\sigma}_{\gamma \gamma} = \sum_{i,j=0}^4 \, \xi_{1i} \xi_{2j} \, 
{\rm d}\hat{\sigma}_{ij} 
\eeq
in the $\xi_{1i}$ and $\xi_{2j}$ photon Stokes parameter basis, with 
zeroth components such that $\xi_{10}=\xi_{20}=1$. The event rate d$N$ can be
then written as
\beq
{\rm d} N \, = \, {\rm d}{\cal L} \, \langle {\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{\gamma 
\gamma}  \rangle \, = \, {\rm d}{\cal L} \, \sum_{i,j=0}^3  \, \langle \xi_{1i}
\xi_{2j} \rangle \, {\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{ij}
\eeq 
where d${\cal L}$ is the differential $\gamma \gamma$ luminosity and  the
average $\langle \xi_{1i} \xi_{2j} \rangle$ is along the interaction region 
[only the diagonal terms in the product are relevant in general]. \s

For circularly polarized laser beams, one has for the average Stokes parameters 
\beq
\langle \xi_{12} \xi_{22} \rangle = \xi_{12} \xi_{22}  \ , \ \langle \xi_{13} 
\xi_{23} \rangle = - \langle \xi_{11} \xi_{21} \rangle \ll 1
\eeq
so that the 
event rate can be written in terms of the luminosities corresponding to the 
$J_Z=0$ and $J_Z=\pm 2$ scattering channels, as
\beq
{\rm d}N \, = \, {\rm d} {\cal L}^{J_Z=0} \, {\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{J_Z=0} \, 
+ \, {\rm d} {\cal L}^{J_Z=\pm 2 } \, {\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{J_Z=\pm 2} 
\hspace*{2cm} \non \\
{\rm d} {\cal L}^{J_Z=0}  =  \frac{1}{2}  {\rm d}{\cal L} \, 
(1 + \langle \xi_{12} \xi_{22} \rangle ) \ , \ 
{\rm d} {\cal L}^{J_Z= \pm 2} = \frac{1}{2}  {\rm d}{\cal L} \, 
(1 - \langle \xi_{12} \xi_{22} \rangle ) 
\eeq

With this polarization, a  broad luminosity spectrum can be achieved by using
electrons and laser photons with like--handed helicities and a small value,
$\rho \sim 0.6$, which leads to low energetic backscattered photons in the
interaction region. In contrast, a sharp spectrum peaking near $y_{\rm max}$
can be obtained using opposite--handed electrons and laser photons in a more
restrictive interaction region $\rho \sim 3$; see Fig.~4.1 (left). The events
in the $J_Z=0\,(J_{Z}= \pm 2)$ channels can be enhanced (suppressed) by
choosing the laser and electron beams so that $x_0=4.83$, which in addition,
maximizes the collider energy.\s

and the configurations for both collider arms are the same; from 
Ref.~\cite{gamma-Jose}.}
\end{figure}

For linearly polarized laser beams, neglecting $\rho \ne 0$ effects for 
simplicity, the average Stokes parameters are
\beq 
\langle \xi_{12} \xi_{22} \rangle &\simeq& \langle \xi_{12} \rangle
\langle \xi_{22} \rangle \, = \, 4 \lambda_{e^-} \lambda_{e^+}  \, c_1 
c_2 \non \\
\langle \xi_{13} \xi_{23} -\xi_{11} \xi_{21} \rangle & \simeq & \langle
\xi_{13} \rangle\langle \xi_{23} \rangle -
\langle \xi_{11} \rangle\langle \xi_{21} \rangle=
P_{1t} P_{2t} \, {\ell}_1 {\ell}_2 \, \cos 2 (\Delta\gamma) 
\eeq 
where  $P_{ti}$ are the mean linear laser polarizations  while $c_i$ and 
$\ell_i$ are the induced circular and linear polarizations of the backscattered
photons; $\Delta\gamma$ is the angle between the planes of maximal linear 
polarization of the two lasers. The circular polarizations $c_i$ and linear 
polarizations $\ell_i$ are large for, respectively,  high and low values of the
parameter $x$, and both increase with $y$. The event rate in this case is 
given by
\beq
 {\rm d}N = {\rm d} {\cal L}^{||}\, {\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{||}
+ {\rm d} {\cal  L}^{\perp}\, {\rm d}\hat{\sigma}_\perp + \frac{1}{2} {\rm d} 
{\cal L}^C \, \left( {\rm d}\hat{\sigma}_{J_Z=0} - {\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{J_Z=2}
\right) \hspace*{3cm}  \\
{\rm  d} {\cal L}^{||} = \frac{1}{2} {\rm d} {\cal L}\,  (1+\langle
\xi_{13} \xi_{23}-\xi_{11} \xi_{21} \rangle) \, , \ 
{\rm d}{\cal  L}^{\perp} = \frac{1}{2} {\rm d} {\cal  L} \,  (1-\langle
\xi_{13} \xi_{23} -\xi_{11} \xi_{21} \rangle) \, , \
{\rm d} {\cal L}^C = {\rm d} {\cal L}\,  \langle \xi_{12} \xi_{22} \rangle \non
\eeq
For this polarization, one has to make a compromise between having a 
good separation of the $||$ and $\perp$ components, which needs a small value
of $x$, and having a high energy which needs a larger value since the available
energy is proportional to $x/(x+1)$. \s

For more details on the main features of the $\gamma \gamma$ machines, such
as energy, luminosity distributions, polarization, etc...,  see the  
reviews given in Refs.~\cite{gamma-Rev-TESLA,gamma-Rev-NLC,gamma-Jose}.

\subsubsection{Future muon colliders}

The concept of $\mu^+\mu^-$ colliders, although introduced already in the late
sixties \cite{mu-Budker}, has been taken very seriously only in the last
decade. A Muon Collider Collaboration (MCC) \cite{mu-machine,mu-machine1} has 
been
formed in the US in the mid--nineties to complete the R\&D that is required to
determine whether a muon collider is technically feasible and, in the case of a
positive answer, to propose a design for a First Muon Collider. In the
late nineties, the European community joined the project and a study report on
the feasibility of a muon collider at CERN has been produced
\cite{mu-machine2}. A three--step scenario for a muon collider is presently
foreseen \cite{mu-machine1,mu-machine2}:\s 

-- $i)$ A first step would be an intense proton source for producing muons 
which will be then captured, cooled, accelerated and stored. In the 
storage ring, they then decay and they allow to produce high--intensity 
and high--quality neutrino beams which could be used to perform detailed studies
of neutrino oscillations and neutrino--nucleon scattering, as well as some
physics with stopped muons such as the measurement of the muon magnetic and 
electric dipole moments and the search for some rare $\mu$ decays.\s  

-- $ii)$ The second step would be a $\mu^+ \mu^-$ collider with a center of 
mass energy in the range $\sqrt{s} \sim 100$--200 GeV. This collider could do 
the same physics as an $e^+e^-$ collider and it will be a Higgs factory 
that would possibly allow to study in more detail the properties of the Higgs 
particles that have been produced at the LHC and at the ILC.\s

-- $iii)$ A final step would be then to operate the muon collider at the
maximum possible c.m. energy and to probe the physics of the multi--TeV scale. 
For instance, energies up to $\sqrt s \sim 7$ TeV could be reached with the 
facilities that are available at CERN. However, with the present designs [and 
not to mention the very high luminosities which need to be achieved in this 
case], the radiation induced by the neutrinos is extremely high for c.m. 
energies in excess of a few TeV and poses a very serious problem. Major 
technological developments are therefore required to reach this high--energy 
step.\s 

In this report, we will be interested only in the second phase of the muon
collider, that is, the Higgs factories with c.m. energies $\sqrt s \lsim 200$
GeV. Compared to an $\ee$ machine, the main advantages of a muon collider as
far as Higgs physics is concerned \cite{mu-Rev1,mu-Rev2,mu-Rev3,mu-Rev4}, are
principally due to the fact that the muon is much heavier than the electron,
$m_\mu/m_e \sim 200$: the Higgs boson coupling to muons is much larger than the
coupling to electrons, yielding significantly larger rates for $s$--channel
Higgs production at muon colliders, $\mu^+ \mu^- \to H$ [the production rate in
this channel is of course negligible in $\ee$ collisions].\s


Another advantage of $\mu^+\mu^-$ colliders, compared to $\ee$ colliders, is
the very precise knowledge of the beam energy spectrum which would allow for
very high precision analyses of the mass, total width and peak cross section of
the produced Higgs resonance. According to the analyses performed in
Ref.~\cite{mu-machine1,mu-machine2}, the energy can be tuned with a precision
$\Delta E_{\rm b}/E_{\rm b} \sim \times 10^{-6}$ [i.e. 100 keV for $\sqrt 
s\!=\! 100$ GeV] and values ten times smaller seem possible. 
The small amount of beamstrahlung [which, in $\ee$ collisions, induces an
energy loss of a few percent that is difficult to measure very precisely] and
bremsstrahlung [again due to the larger mass of the muon compared to the
electron] could lead to a relative beam energy spread or resolution of the
order of $R= \sigma_{ E_{\rm b} }/E_{\rm b} \sim 10^{-3}$ down to $R= 3 \times
10^{-5}$ and which could be known with an accuracy of $ \Delta \sigma_{E_{\rm
b} }/E_{\rm b} \sim 0.5\%$. Such a small energy spread is very important when
performing a scan around the very narrow Higgs resonance, $\Gamma_H \sim 
2$ MeV for $M_H \sim 100$ GeV. In addition, since synchrotron radiation is also
very small, one can still use the available circular machines. 
The energy calibration can be made by spin precession as the muons that are
produced in the weak decays of pions are 100\% polarized, leading to a natural
longitudinal polarization of approximately 30\% which, however, drops to the
level of $\sim 20\%$ due to the handling before injection into the collider. The
drawback, compared to $\ee$ machines, is that it is difficult to maximize this 
polarization without an important loss in luminosity and that a muon collider 
cannot be turned into a $\gamma \gamma$ or $\mu \gamma$ collider.\s

Nevertheless, the design of the machine is still at an early stage and  many
problems remain to be solved \cite{mu-machine1,mu-machine2}.  In addition, the
delivered luminosity which can be achieved is still uncertain, and it depends
strongly on the baseline parameters of the collider; Tab.~4.2. There is, for 
instance, a particularly strong dependence on the beam energy resolution. As 
can be seen from the table, at $\sqrt s=100$ GeV, the estimates indicate that
only ${\cal 
L} \sim 10^{31}\, (10^{32})\, {\rm cm}^{-2}{\rm s}^{-1}$ can be obtained for a
resolution of $R= 0.003\%\, (0.1\%)$, leading to an integrated luminosity 
$\int {\cal L}=0.1\, (1)~{\rm fb}^{-1}$ per year. The luminosity, however can 
substantially be increased with energy reaching, for $R \sim 0.1$\%, values of 
the order of ${\cal L}\sim 10^{33}\, (10^{35})\, {\rm cm}^{-2}{\rm s}^{-1}$ for 
$\sqrt{s} \sim 0.4\, (3)$ TeV; see Table 4.2 and the details given in 
Refs.~\cite{mu-machine1,mu-machine2}. \s

\subsubsection{Higgs production processes in lepton collisions}

In $\ee$ collisions with center of mass energies beyond LEP2, the main
production mechanisms for Higgs particles are the Higgs--strahlung process 
\cite{EGN,LQT,Bjorken-process,Petcov,Higgs-strahlung} and the $WW$ fusion 
mechanism \cite{Petcov,VVH-Cahn,VVH-DW,VVH-Altarelli,VVH-Kilian,WWH-ee-Dawson,VVH-Hikasa}, 
depicted in Fig.~4.2,
\begin{eqnarray}
{\rm Higgs-strahlung \ process} : & & \ee \longrightarrow (Z^*) 
\longrightarrow Z \, H \\
{\rm WW \ fusion \ process} : & & \ee \longrightarrow \bar{\nu}\nu \, (W^*W^*)
\longrightarrow \bar{\nu}\ \nu \, H

\vspace*{7.mm}
\end{center}
There are several other mechanisms in which Higgs bosons can be produced in 
$\ee$ collisions: the $ZZ$ fusion process 
\cite{VVH-Cahn,VVH-DW,VVH-Hikasa,VVH-Altarelli,ZZH-Kilian}, the 
radiation off heavy top quarks \cite{ee-ttH0,ee-ttH} and the double Higgs boson
production process either in Higgs--strahlung or $WW/ZZ$ fusion 
\cite{pp-HVV,pp-VVHH,ee-HHZ,HH-Barger,ee-DKMZ}
\begin{eqnarray}
{\rm ZZ \ fusion \ process} : & & \ee \lra e^+ e^- (Z^*Z^*) \lra e^+ e^- \, 
H \\
{\rm radiation \ off \ heavy\ fermions}:& & \ee \lra (\gamma^*,Z^*) \lra f 
\bar{f} \, H \\
{\rm double\ Higgs\ production}: & & \ee \lra Z H H \, , \, \ell \ell HH 
\end{eqnarray}
These are, in principle, higher--order processes in the electroweak coupling 
with production cross sections much smaller than those of the Higgs--strahlung 
process and the $WW$ fusion channel [for $ZZ$ fusion, only at low energies]. 
However, with the high luminosity planned 
for future linear colliders, they can be detected and studied. These processes 
are extremely interesting since they allow for the determination of some of the 
fundamental properties of the Higgs particle, such as its self--coupling and 
its Yukawa coupling to top quarks. \s

There also other higher--order processes in which Higgs particles can be
produced in $\ee$ collisions, but with even smaller production cross sections
than those mentioned previously: associated production with a photon, $\ee \ra
H+ \gamma$ \cite{ee-Hgamma}, loop induced Higgs pair production, $\ee \ra
HH$ \cite{ee-HHloop}, associated production with vector bosons, $\ee \ra
VV + H$ \cite{ee-HVff,ee-HVV}, and associated production with a gauge boson 
and two fermions, $\ee \ra VH + f\bar{f}$ \cite{ee-HVff}. Except possibly for 
the two latter processes, the cross sections are in general below the femtobarn 
level and, thus, too small for the processes to be detected at future machines, 
unless extremely high--luminosities are made available. \s

Higgs particles can be produced as $s$--channel resonances 
\cite{gamma-Rev-old,BBC}
[among other possibilities  which will be also discussed] in the 
$\gam$ option of future $\ee$ linear colliders 
\beq
\gamma \gamma \lra H 
\eeq
allowing the measurement of the important $H \gamma \gamma$ coupling. In the 
$e \gamma$ option, one can also produce the Higgs boson in the channel
$e \gamma \to \nu_e W^- H$ \cite{egamma-H}. \s

Finally,  on can also produce the Higgs boson as an $s$--channel resonance at 
future muon colliders \cite{mu-Rev1,mu-schannel}
\beq
\mu^+ \mu^- \lra H
\eeq

In the following sections, we discuss the dominant production processes in some
detail and summarize the main features of the subleading processes.  We first
focus on $\ee$ linear colliders in the  $\ee$ option, and discuss in more
details the physics potential at the first phase with center of mass energies
around $\sqrt{s} \sim 500$ GeV \cite{ee-Review-old,ee-Review-DESY};
occasionally, we will comment on the benefits of raising the energy of the
machine. The case of the $\gamma \gamma$ option of the machine, as well as the
physics at future muon colliders will be postponed to, respectively, the
previous--to--last and last sections.\s 

Since $\ee$ colliders are known to be high--precision machines as
demonstrated at LEP and SLC, the theoretical predictions have to be rather
accurate and thus the radiative corrections to the Higgs production  
processes have to be taken into account. The one--loop electroweak and QCD 
radiative corrections to the most important production mechanisms have been 
completed only recently 
\cite{RCHZ,RCWW1,RCWW2,RCWW3,RCZZ,RCTTqcd1,RCTTqcd2,RCTTew1,RCTTew2,RCTTew0,RCZHH1,RCZHH2,RCWWHH} and their main effects will be summarized.\s

In addition, the main motivation of future $\ee$ in the sub--TeV 
energy range is the detailed exploration of the electroweak symmetry breaking 
mechanism and the thorough study of the fundamental properties of the Higgs 
particle, in particular the spin and parity quantum numbers. At least in the 
main processes, we study the energy and the angular dependence of the 
cross sections as well as the angular correlations of the final decay products,
and confront, whenever possible, the predictions for the $J^{\rm PC}=0^{++}$ 
case of the SM Higgs particle to what would be expected if the Higgs were a 
pseudoscalar boson with $J^{\rm PC}=0^{+-}$ spin--parity assignments. We also 
discuss the measurements of the Higgs mass and total decay width, the Higgs 
couplings to fermions and gauge bosons, and the Higgs self--coupling which 
allows for the reconstruction of part of the scalar potential that is 
responsible of the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry. \s

Some particular points relevant to this section have been already discussed in 
the context of hadron colliders or in the section on the decays of the Higgs 
particle. However, some important features will be rediscussed in the context 
of lepton colliders, to make the section more complete and self--contained.

\subsection{The dominant production processes in $\ee$ collisions}

\subsubsection{The Higgs--strahlung mechanism}

\subsubsection*{\underline{The production cross section}}

The production cross section for the Higgs strahlung process is given by
\beq 
\sigma(\ee \ra ZH) = \frac{G_\mu^2 M_Z^4}{96 \pi s} (\hat{v}_e^2+\hat{a}_e^2) \ 
\lambda^{1/2} \frac{ \lambda+ 12M_Z^2/s}{(1-M_Z^2/s)^2} 
\eeq
where, as usual, $\hat{a}_e=-1$ and $\hat{v}_e=-1+4s_W^2$ are the $Z$ charges 
of the electron and $\lambda^{1/2}$ the usual two--particle phase--space 
function
\beq
\lambda=(1-M_H^2/s-M_Z^2/s)^2-4M_H^2M_Z^2/s^2
\eeq
The production cross section is shown in  Fig.~4.3 as a function of the Higgs
mass for the values of the c.m energy $\sqrt{s}=0.5,1$ and 3 TeV.  At
$\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV, $\sigma(\ee \to HZ)  \sim $ 50 fb for $M_H \sim 150$ GeV,
leading to a total of $\sim $ 25.000 Higgs particles that are created at an
integrated luminosity of $\int {\cal L} =500\ {\rm fb}^{-1}$, as expected for 
future machines. The cross section  scales as the inverse of the c.m. energy,
$\sigma \sim 1/s$ and, for moderate Higgs masses, it is larger   for
smaller c.m.  energies. The maximum value of the cross section for a given 
$M_H$ value is at $\sqrt{s} \sim M_Z +\sqrt{2}M_H$. An energy 
of the order of $\sqrt{s} \sim 800$ GeV is needed to cover the entire Higgs
boson mass range allowed  in the SM, $M_H \lsim 700$ GeV.

Higgs--strahlung mechanism in $\ee$ collisions with c.m. energies 
$\sqrt{s}=0.5,1$ and 3 TeV as a function of $M_H$.} 
\vspace*{-.5cm}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{\underline{The energy dependence}}

The recoiling $Z$ boson in the two--body reaction $\ee \ra ZH$ is
mono--energetic, $E_Z = (s-M_H^2+M_Z^2)/(2\sqrt{s})$, and the mass of the Higgs
boson can be derived from the energy of the $Z$ boson, $M_H^2 =s -2\sqrt{s} E_Z
+M_Z^2$, if the initial $e^+$ and $e^-$ beam energies  are sharp. \s

The excitation curve rises linearly with the phase--space factor 
$\lambda^{1/2}$, which is characteristic to the production of a scalar 
particle in association with a $Z$ boson  
\beq
\sigma (\ee \to HZ) \sim \lambda^{1/2} \sim \sqrt{s -(M_H+M_Z)^2} 
\eeq
This behavior for the $J^{\rm PC}=0^{++}$ SM Higgs boson can be compared with
the case of a CP--odd Higgs boson $A$ with $J^{\rm PC}=0^{+-}$ quantum 
numbers and with couplings given in \S2. The total production cross section
for the process $\ee \to ZA$ \cite{Bargeretal,ee-HZ-stong}
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma (\ee \to ZA) = \eta^2\frac{G_\mu^2M_Z^6}{48\pi M_A^4} \, 
(\hat{a}_e^2+\hat{v}_e^2) \, \frac{\lambda^{3/2}}{(1-M_Z^2/s)^2}
\end{eqnarray}
has a momentum dependence $\sim \lambda^{3/2}$ that is characteristically
different  from the $ZH$ cross section near threshold. This is illustrated in
Fig.~4.4, where the behavior near the production threshold for the assignments
$J^{\rm PC}= 0^{++}$ and $0^{+-}$ is shown for a Higgs mass $M_H=120$ GeV.\s

\begin{figure}[!h]

the threshold for the two parity cases $\Phi=H$ and $\Phi=A$ [with $\eta=1]$ 
with $M_\Phi=120$ GeV.}
\vspace*{-.2cm}
\end{figure}

In fact, as discussed in Ref.~\cite{ee-Hspin}, the linear threshold behavior of
the SM Higgs boson rules out not only the quantum number $J^{\rm P}=0^{-}$ but
also $J^{\rm P}=1^{-}, 2^{+}$ and higher spin $3^\pm,  \cdots$, which rise
with higher powers of  $\lambda$ too.  The production of states with the two
remaining spin--parity assignments $J^{\rm P}=1^+, 2^+$ can be ruled out using 
the angular correlations as is discussed hereafter.  

\subsubsection*{\underline{ The angular distribution}}

The angular distribution of the $Z/H$ bosons in the bremsstrahlung process is 
also sensitive to the spin of the Higgs particle \cite{ee-HZ-ang}. The explicit
form of the angular distribution, with $\theta$ being the scattering angle, is 
given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{ {\rm d}\sigma (\ee \to ZH)} { {\rm d} \cos \theta} \sim \lambda^2
\sin^2\theta +8M_Z^2/s  \ \stackrel{ s \gg M_Z^2} \longrightarrow  \ 
\frac{3}{4} \sin^2\theta
\end{eqnarray}
and approaches the spin--zero distribution asymptotically, $\propto \sin^2
\theta$, in accordance with the equivalence theorem which requires that the 
production amplitude becomes equal to the amplitude where the $Z$ boson is 
replaced by the neutral Goldstone boson $w_0$. Thus, for high energies, the $Z$ 
boson is produced in a state of longitudinal
polarization
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\sigma_L} {\sigma_L +\sigma_T} = 1- \frac{8M_Z^2}{12M_Z^2+\lambda s}
\end{eqnarray}
Let us again confront the characteristics of a $J^{\rm PC}=0^{++}$ state with
those of a pseudoscalar Higgs boson $A$. In the  process $\ee \to ZA$, the 
angular distribution is given by 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{ {\rm d}\sigma (\ee \to ZA)} { {\rm d} \cos \theta} \sim 1+ \cos^2\theta
\end{eqnarray}
independent of the energy. The $Z$ boson in the final state is purely
transversally polarized, so that the cross section need not be $\sim
\sin^2\theta$ in this case.\s

If the Higgs particle were a mixture $\Phi$ of scalar and pseudoscalar bosons, 
with a coupling to the virtual and real $Z$ bosons given by 
\beq
g_{ZZ\Phi}=g_{ZZH} \bigg( g_{\mu \nu} + i \eta M_Z^{-2}\epsilon_{\mu \nu 
\rho \sigma} p^\sigma_{Z} p^\rho_Z \bigg)
\eeq
the angular distribution of $\ee \to \Phi Z$ would read [$A_f= 2a_f 
v_f/(a_f^2+a_f^2)$ as usual]
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{ {\rm d}\sigma (\ee \to Z\Phi)} { {\rm d} \cos \theta} \sim 1+ 
\frac{s\lambda^2}{8M_Z^2} \sin^2\theta + \eta A_e \frac{s \lambda}{M_Z^2}
\cos \theta + \eta^2 \frac{s^2\lambda^2}{M_Z^4} (1+\cos^2\theta)
\label{HZ:angular}
\end{eqnarray}
The presence of the interference term proportional to $\eta$ is a clear 
indication of CP--violation in the Higgs sector. One can thus define an
observable \cite{ee-HZ-cos}, conveniently written as, 
\beq
\langle O \rangle = 2 {\rm Re} \bigg( \frac{ {\cal M} (\ee \to ZH) 
{\cal M}^* (\ee \to ZA) } { | {\cal M} (\ee \to ZH)| ^2 } \bigg) \propto  
\eta A_e \frac{s \lambda}{M_Z^2}
\label{Oobservable}
\eeq
which quantifies the amount of this CP--violation. \s

$\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV and $M_H=120$ GeV. The distributions for  the CP--odd Higgs
and $\ee \to ZZ$ cases are also shown.}
%\vspace*{-.5cm}
\end{figure}

The angular momentum structure specific to Higgs production can also directly
be  confronted experimentally with the one of the process $e^+e^- \rightarrow  
ZZ$ that is distinctly different. Mediated by electron exchange in the
$t$--channel, the amplitude for this process is built--up by many partial waves,
peaking in the forward/backward directions. The two angular distributions, 
together with the angular distribution for the CP--odd Higgs case, $\ee \to AZ$,
are compared with each other in Fig.~4.5 which demonstrates the specific 
character of the SM Higgs production process. 

\subsubsection*{\underline{The angular correlations}}

The pattern for the $Z$ boson polarization in the $\ee \to HZ,HA$ and $ZZ$ 
processes can be checked \cite{Bargeretal,ee-HZ-stong}: while the distribution 
of the fermions in the $Z 
\to  f\bar{f}$ rest frame with respect to the $Z$ flight direction is given by 
$\sin^2\theta_*$ for longitudinally polarized $Z$ bosons, it behaves as 
$(1\pm \cos\theta_*)^2$ for transversally polarized states, after averaging 
over the azimuthal angles. The definition of the polar angles  $\theta$ and 
$\theta_*$ is shown in Fig.~4.6; the azimuthal angle $\phi_*$ is the angle 
between the plane of the $f\bar{f}$ from $Z$ decays and the Higgs decay 
products. \s

Including the azimuthal angles, the final angular correlations may be written
for the process $e^+e^- \rightarrow  ZH$ with $Z\rightarrow  f \bar{f}$ as
\cite{Bargeretal}
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{ {\rm d}\sigma (\ee \to ZH)} { {\rm d} c_\theta {\rm d} c_{\theta_*}
{\rm d} \phi_*} &\sim & s^2_\theta s^2_{\theta_*} -\frac{1}{2 \gamma} s_{2
\theta} s_{2\theta_*} c_{\phi_*} + \frac{1}{2\gamma^2} [(1+c^2_\theta)(1
+c^2_{\theta_*})+s^2_\theta s^2_{\theta_*} c_{2\phi_*} ] \nonumber \\
&&- 2A_e A_f\frac{1}{\gamma} \left[ s_\theta s_{\theta_*} c_{\phi_*} -
\frac{1}{\gamma} c_\theta c_{\theta_*} \right]
\end{eqnarray}
where $s_\theta= \sin \theta$ $etc$, $A_f=2v_fa_f/(v_f^2+a_f^2)$ and $\gamma^2
=E^2/M_Z^2= 1+ \lambda s/4M_Z^2$. As before, $\theta$ is the polar $Z$ angle 
in the laboratory frame, $\theta_*$ the polar fermion angle in the $Z$ rest 
frame and $\phi_*$ the corresponding azimuthal angle with respect to the 
$\ee \to ZH$ production plane. After integrating out the polar angles 
$\theta$ and $\theta_*$, one finds the familiar $\cos \phi_*$ and $\cos 2 
\phi_*$ dependence discussed in \S2.2.4 associated with P--odd and even 
amplitudes, respectively
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{ {\rm d}\sigma (\ee \to ZH)} { {\rm d} \phi_*} \sim 1+a_1 \cos \phi_*
+ a_2 \cos 2\phi_* \non \\
a_1= -\frac{9\pi^2}{32}\, A_e A_f\, \frac{\gamma}{\gamma^2+2}\, \, 
,\qquad a_2= \frac{1}{2}\,\frac{1}{\gamma^2+2}
\end{eqnarray}
The azimuthal angular dependence disappears for high energies $\sim 1/\gamma$
as a result of the dominating longitudinal polarization of the $Z$ boson.\s

Note again the characteristic difference to the $0^{+-}$ case, 
$e^+e^- \rightarrow  ZA \to f\bar{f} A$ \cite{Bargeretal,CP-full}
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{ {\rm d} \sigma (\ee \to ZA)} { {\rm d} c_\theta {\rm d} c_{\theta_*}
{\rm d} \phi_*} &\sim & 1+ c^2_\theta c^2_{\theta_*} -\frac{1}{2}
s^2_\theta s^2_{\theta_*} -\frac{1}{2} s^2_\theta s^2_{\theta_* }
c_{2\phi_*} + 2 A_e A_f c_\theta c_{\theta_*}

\vspace*{3mm}

This time, the azimuthal dependence is P--even and independent of the
energy in contrast to the $0^{++}$ case; after integrating out the polar
$\theta, \theta_*$ angles, one obtains
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{ {\rm d}\sigma (\ee \to ZA) }{ {\rm d} \phi_* }\sim 1 - \frac{1}{4}
\cos 2\phi_*
\end{eqnarray}

The production of the two states with $J^{\rm
P}=1^+, 2^-$ quantum numbers, which also lead to a $\beta$ behavior near the
kinematical threshold as in the $0^+$ case, can be ruled out using the angular
correlations as they lead to $(1+c_\theta^2)s_{\theta_*}^2$ and
$(1+c_{\theta_*}^2)s_{\theta}^2$ distributions which are absent in the SM Higgs
case \cite{CPHVVchoi}.\s 

We can thus conclude that the angular analysis of the Higgs production in
$e^+e^- \rightarrow  Z^* \rightarrow  ZH$ with $Z \rightarrow  f \bar{f}$,
together with the threshold behavior of the cross section, allows stringent
tests of the $J^{\rm PC}=0^{++}$ quantum numbers of the Higgs boson in the low
and intermediate mass range. In the high mass range, $M_H \gsim 2M_W$, when
the Higgs boson decays almost exclusively into two vector bosons, the Higgs
spin--zero and parity can be checked not only in the production process $\ee\to
HZ$, but also in the decay processes $H\to VV \to 4f$ as discussed in \S2.2.4. 
The full correlations between the final decay products $\ee \to ZH \to ZVV \to 
6f$ has not been yet worked out explicitly because of the rather complicated 
six fermion final state. 
  
\subsubsection{The WW fusion process} 

\subsubsection*{\underline{The production cross section}}

The $WW$ fusion process 
\cite{VVH-Cahn,VVH-DW,VVH-Hikasa,VVH-Altarelli,VVH-Kilian,Petcov}
is most important for  small values of the ratio $M_H/\sqrt{s}$, {\it i.e.} 
high energies where the cross  section grows $\sim M_W^{-2}$log$(s/M_H^2)$.  
The production cross section, discussed in \S3.3  at hadron colliders, can be 
more conveniently written as 
\beq 
\sigma= \frac{G_\mu^3 M_V^4}{64 \sqrt{2} \pi^3} \int_{\kappa_H}^1 {\rm d}x
\int_x^1 \frac{ {\rm d}y}{[1+(y-x)/ \kappa_V]^2} \left[ (\hat{v}_e^2+\hat{a}_e
^2)^2 f(x,y) + 4 \hat{v}_e^2 \hat{a}_e^2 g(x,y) \right] \label{WWxsection} 
\eeq 
\vspace*{-6mm}
\beq 
f(x,y) &=& \left(\frac{2x}{y^3} -\frac{1+2x}{y^2} +\frac{2+x}{2y}
-\frac{1}{2} \right)\left[ \frac{z}{1+z} -\log (1+z) \right]
+\frac{x}{y^3}\frac{z^2(1-y)} {1+z} \non \\ 
g(x,y) &=& \left(-\frac{x}{y^2} +\frac{2+x}{2y} -\frac{1}{2} \right) 
\left[ \frac{z}{1+z} -\log (1+z) \right]
\non 
\eeq 
with $\kappa_H =M_H^2/s, \kappa_V=M_V^2/s , z=y(x-\kappa_H)/(\kappa_Vx)$ and 
$\hat{v}, \hat{a}$ the electron couplings to the massive gauge bosons, $\hat{v
}_e=\hat{a}_e=\sqrt{2}$ for  the $W$ boson. [Note that in the effective 
longitudinal $W$ approximation, and as discussed in \S3.3.5, one obtains a 
simple result for the cross section of this process, but  which is
twice larger than the exact result for small Higgs boson masses.].\s

The production cross section is shown in Fig.~4.7 as a function of $M_H$ at c.m
energies $\sqrt{s}=0.5, 1$ and 3 TeV. For Higgs masses in the intermediate
range, the cross section is comparable to the one of the Higgs--strahlung
process at $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV, leading to $\sim 25.000$ events for the expected
luminosity ${\cal L} =500 \ {\rm fb}^{-1}$, and is larger at higher energies.

\subsubsection*{\underline{The full cross section with the interference with 
Higgs--strahlung}}

The overall cross section that will be observed experimentally for  the process
$e^+e^- \to H\!+\!\bar\nu\nu$ will not be due to the $WW$ fusion process only,
but  part of it will come from the Higgs--strahlung  process,  $\ee \to HZ$,
with the $Z$ boson decaying into the three types of neutrinos.  A compact
expression for the full cross section of the Higgs--strahlung and $WW$ fusion 
mechanisms, including the interference terms,  has been derived in the general 
case by choosing the energy $E_H$ and the polar angle $\theta$ of the Higgs 
particle as the basic variables in the $e^+e^-$ c.m.\ frame. Decomposing  the
total contribution into three parts,  the contributions $3\times{g}_S$  from
Higgs--strahlung with $Z$ decays into three types of neutrinos, ${g}_W$
from $WW$ fusion, and ${g}_I$ from the interference term between  fusion
and Higgs--strahlung for $\bar\nu_e\nu_e$ final states, one has  for energies
$\sqrt{s}$ above the $Z$ resonance \cite{VVH-Altarelli,VVH-Kilian}

\begin{eqnarray}
&&  \frac{d\sigma(\ee \to H\bar\nu\nu)}{dE_H\,d\cos\theta}
  = \frac{G_\mu^3 M_Z^8p_H}{\sqrt2\,\pi^3s}
  \left(3\,g_S + g_I + g_W \right) \\
g_S &=& \frac{\hat{v}_e^2+\hat{a}_e^2}{96}\; \frac{ss_\nu + s_1s_2}
{\left(s-M_Z^2\right)^2 \left[(s_\nu-M_Z^2)^2 + M_Z^2\Gamma_Z^2\right]} \ , \ \
g_W= \frac{c^8_W}{s_1 s_2 r} \, {\cal H}_+ \non   \\
g_I &=& \frac{(\hat{v}_e+\hat{a}_e)c_W^4}{8}\; \frac{s_\nu-M_Z^2}
{\left(s-M_Z^2\right) \left[(s_\nu-M_Z^2)^2 + M_Z^2\Gamma_Z^2\right]}
\, {\cal H}_I
\end{eqnarray}
where all the abbreviated quantities have been defined in 
eq.~(\ref{pp:VVHabrev}), the factor ${\cal H}_+$ in eq.~(\ref{pp:VVH+H-}), 
while the factor ${\cal H}_I$ for the interference term is given by
\beq
{\cal H}_I= 2 - (h_1+1)\log\frac{h_1+1}{h_1-1}
             - (h_2+1)\log\frac{h_2+1}{h_2-1}
           +\, (h_1+1)(h_2+1)\frac{\ell}{\sqrt{r}}
\eeq
To derive the total cross section $\sigma(e^+e^-\to H\bar\nu\nu)$, the
differential cross section must be integrated over $\theta$ and $E_H$, with the
boundary conditions given in eq.~(\ref{pp:VVHbound}). The two main components 
and the total cross section for $e^+e^-\to H\bar\nu\nu$ are displayed in 
Fig.~4.8 as a function of the c.m. energy  for $M_H=115$ and 150 GeV. 
One can see that Higgs-strahlung is dominant a lower energies, $WW$ fusion at
higher energies, and the  interference term is small except in the cross over 
regions. \s

\end{figure}%

At $\ee$ colliders, the initial $e^\pm$  beams can be polarized longitudinally.
The Higgs--strahlung and $WW$ fusion require opposite helicities of the $e^-$ 
and $e^+$ beams.~Denoting~$\sigma_{U,L,R}$ the cross sections for 
unpolarized $e^-/e^+$, $e^-_L/e^+_R$ and $e^-_R/e^+_L$, respectively, one 
obtains \cite{VVH-Kilian}
\begin{eqnarray}
  \sigma_U  \propto 3\, g_S + g_I + g_W \ , \ \
  \sigma_L  \propto 6\, g_S + 4\,g_I + 4\,g_W\ , \ \   
  \sigma_R \propto 6\, g_S
\end{eqnarray}
The cross section for $WW$ fusion of Higgs particles increases by a
factor four, compared with unpolarized beams, if left--handed electrons
and right--handed positrons are used.  By using right--handed electrons,
the $WW$ fusion mechanism is switched off. The interference term
cannot be separated from the $WW$ fusion cross section.

\subsubsection{The electroweak radiative corrections}

To have a full control on the production cross sections of the Higgs--strahlung 
and $WW$ fusion processes, in view of the high--precision tests which can be 
performed using them, the electroweak radiative corrections must be taken 
into account. These corrections, consisting of virtual and real corrections 
with the emission of an additional photon in the final or initial state (ISR), 
have been completed recently. Note, however, that at high--energy linear 
colliders, in addition to ISR, one has also to take into account the beam 
energy spread and beamstrahlung. The latter is machine dependent and will 
smear out the c.m. energy and the system moves along the beam axes; it must
be thus suppressed  as strongly as possible in order to allow for high--quality
analyses which are often based on kinematical constraints derived 
from the precise knowledge of the initial beam energies. 

\subsubsection*{\underline{The Higgs--strahlung process}}

At one--loop order, the radiative corrections to the Higgs--strahlung 
process consist of  self--energy, vertex and box corrections to the tree--level
amplitude and the emission of an additional photon in the initial state;
Fig.~4.9.  The corrections have been calculated some time ago \cite{RCHZ} and
reanalyzed recently in the context of the full $\ee \to H\bar{\nu} \nu$ 
process \cite{RCWW1,RCWW2,RCWW3}. Let us summarize the salient features of these
corrections.

The photonic corrections to the initial state, that is vertex and self--energy
corrections with photon exchange as well as photon radiation (ISR) can be
implemented using the structure function approach discussed in \S1.2.1; see,
eq.~(\ref{QEDradiator}).  The fermionic corrections which  are contained in
the running of the QED constant $\alpha$ for the light fermions,
eq.~(\ref{Deltaalpha}), and the correction to the $\rho$ parameter for the
heavy top quark, eq.~(\ref{deltarho}), can be incorporated by using the
improved Born approximation (IBA): starting with the Born cross section defined
in terms of the bare electromagnetic coupling $\alpha(0)$, one performs the
substitution $\pi \alpha(0) \to \sqrt{2}G_F M_W^2 (1-M_W^2/M_Z^2)$ which
absorbs the correction $\Delta r \simeq  \Delta \alpha - 3 \Delta  \rho$.  One
has also to include the additional corrections to the $HZZ$ vertex and in
particular the heavy top contributions, $\delta^t_{HZZ}$ in
eq.~(\ref{WWHvertex}).  The largest part of the weak correction is then
absorbed into the couplings and the remaining  corrections should be in
principle rather small \cite{RCWW1}. \s

The overall correction to the tree--level $\ee \to HZ$ amplitude,  including
an additional term that is logarithmic in the top quark mass, is given by
\cite{RCreviewEW}
\beq
K_{\ee \to HZ}^t \simeq 1 + \frac{\alpha}{4\pi s_W^2}\frac{1}{g_i} 
\left[ \frac{1}{8} \left( 6 \frac{c_W}{s_W} + g_i  \right)
\frac{m_t^2}{M_W^2} + \frac{3 -2s_W^2}{3c_Ws_W} \log \frac{m_t}{M_W} \right]
\eeq
These factors correct in fact the amplitudes with left-- and right--handed
electrons with couplings $g_{L}=(2s_W^2- 1)/(2s_W c_W)$ and $g_R= s_W/c_W$. 
At low and moderate energies, this approximation is rather good. However, at
high energies, it turns out that this expression in the heavy--top quark limit 
does not reproduce exactly the full $m_t$ dependent result, as a consequence 
of the presence of the box contributions  which depend both on $s$ and $m_t$.

\subsubsection*{\underline{The WW fusion process}}

Since already at the tree--level the $WW$--fusion mechanism is a three--body
final state production process [which was thus not trivial to handle], the
calculation of the one--loop radiative corrections is a real challenge. 
Indeed, not only one has to deal with the numerous diagrams involving
self--energy, vertex and box corrections [due to the additional final state,
the number of such diagrams is much larger than for a $2\to 2$ process like
Higgs--strahlung], one has to consider in addition one--loop corrections
involving pentagonal diagrams which are extremely difficult to handle, and
corrections with real photon emission, leading to four particles in the final
state which are rather involved; see Fig.~4.10. To these complications, one has
to add the fact that to derive the full corrections to the $\ee \to H\nu
\bar{\nu}$ final state, both the $WW$ fusion mechanism and the Higgs--strahlung
process with $Z \to \nu \bar{\nu}$ have to be considered and added coherently.

The challenge of deriving these corrections has been met by three groups. In
Ref.\cite{RCWW2}, the calculation was performed using {\tt GRACE-LOOP}
\cite{GRACE}, an automatic calculation system. In Ref.~\cite{RCWW3}, the
results have been obtained as a {\tt MAPLE} output using the program  {\tt
DIANA} \cite{Diana} without an explicit evaluation. In Ref.~\cite{RCWW1}, the
calculation has been performed in two independent ways, using the program {\tt
FeynArts} \cite{Feynarts} to generate the Feynman  graphs, and using {\tt
Mathematica} to express the amplitudes in terms of standard matrix elements or
using the package {\tt FormCalc} \cite{Formcalc} based on {\tt Form} 
\cite{Form}. We briefly summarize the main results of these calculations, 
mostly relying on Ref.\cite{RCWW1}. \s

The ISR corrections stemming from the radiation of a photon from the initial
$\ee$ states and from the intermediate $W$ bosons, can again be obtained in the
structure function approach either at ${\cal O}(\alpha)$  or including 
higher--order corrections. The running of the electromagnetic constant due to 
the light fermion contributions [because the cross section  is proportional to
$\alpha^3$, this leads to a $\sim 18$\% change of the cross section]  can be
included using the IBA discussed previously. Finally,  since the $WW$--fusion
cross section gets its main contribution from  small momenta $W$ bosons, the
loop corrections are mainly determined  by the $\nu_e eW$ and $HWW$ vertices at
zero--momentum transfer.  The  correction to the  $e\nu_eW$ vertex is well
described by $\Delta r$ and  the $HWW$ vertex correction is given by
$\delta^t_{HWW}$ in eq.~({\ref{WWHvertex}). It turns out that these corrections
largely cancel the corresponding ones when $G_\mu$ is used in the tree--level
expression of the amplitude and one obtains a small remaining piece \cite{RCWW1}
\beq
K_{\ee \to H \nu \bar{\nu} }^{t} = 1 - \frac{5 \alpha}{16
\pi s_W^2} \frac{m_t^2}{M_W^2} 
\eeq
which approximates the fermionic contribution to the amplitude quite 
well. To this correction, one has to add the bosonic contribution for which
no simple approximation is possible.

\vspace*{-2mm}
\subsubsection*{\underline{Numerical results}}

The final output of the calculation is shown in Fig.~4.11, where the radiative
corrections to the Higgs strahlung process [left figure] and the the $WW$ 
fusion mechanism [right figure], without the small interference terms, are shown
as a function of $\sqrt{s}$ for $M_H=150$ GeV. The various components, the 
fermionic contribution, the bosonic contribution, the  initial state radiation
at ${\cal O}(\alpha)$ and beyond, are displayed. \s

In the case of $WW$ fusion, the ISR corrections, the bulk of which comes from
${\cal O}(\alpha)$ contributions, are negative for all energies as a
consequence of the decrease of the effective c.m. energy which leads to a
smaller cross section. The fermionic corrections are negative and small, being
at the level of $-2$\%, while the bosonic corrections range from $+1$\%   near
the production threshold to $-3$\% at high energy.  For the Higgs strahlung
process, at high enough energies $\sqrt{s}\gsim 500$ GeV, the fermionic
contribution is positive and almost constant, $+10\%$, while the bosonic 
contribution is negative and large, increasing in absolute value with 
$\sqrt{s}$. The largest correction is due to the ${\cal O}(\alpha)$ ISR [
the contribution of higher--orders is again very small], which increases the 
cross section by $20$\% for $\sqrt{s}=1$ TeV.\s

Adding the channel where the neutrinos are coming from the Higgs--strahlung
process and the small  interference term, one obtains the total production
cross section for the full $\ee \to H \nu \bar{\nu}$ process. The relative
corrections to the lowest  order cross section for the various components are
shown in Fig.~4.12 for $M_H=115$ and 150 GeV as a function of $\sqrt{s}$. Below
the threshold, the correction to the $ZH$ channel are large and negative,
reaching $\sim -20$\%, rise fastly near threshold, and at $\sqrt{s}=1$ TeV 
reach the level of $\sim 20\, (10)$\% for $M_H=115\, (150)$ GeV. The
corrections to the $WW$ fusion channel rise also sharply at the threshold but
reach quickly a plateau at a level of $-10$\% beyond $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV. The
corrections to the complete process follow those of the $WW$ component at high
energy and those of the $HZ$ process at low energies, a consequence of the
relative magnitude of the two processes at tree--level. They are always
negative, being of order $-10$\% at $\sqrt{s} \gsim 350$ GeV.

\subsection{The subleading production processes in $\ee$ collisions}

\subsubsection{The ZZ fusion mechanism}

The cross section for the $ZZ$ fusion mechanism, $\ee \to e^+e^- (Z^*Z^*) \to
\ee H$, Fig.~4.13, is given by the same expression in eq.~(\ref{WWxsection})
for the $WW$ fusion mechanism with the vector boson  $V=Z$ having the usual
couplings to the electron $\hat{v}_e=-1+4s_W^2 , \hat{a}_e=-1$. The total
production  cross section is about an order of magnitude smaller than the cross
section for $WW$ fusion, $\sigma(WW \to H)/\sigma (ZZ \to H)  \sim 16 c_W^2
\sim 9$,  a mere consequence of the fact that the neutral current couplings are
smaller than the charged current couplings. The lower rate, however, could be
at least partly compensated by the clean signature of the $\ee$ final state.
The cross section is shown in Fig.~4.14 as a function of $M_H$ for the c.m.
energies $\sqrt{s}=0.5$, 1 and 3 TeV. It follows the same trend as the $WW$
fusion cross section.

Similarly to the $WW$ fusion case,  the overall cross section for the process
$e^+e^- \to H + e^+e^-$ receives contributions $g_S$ from Higgs--strahlung with
$Z \to \ee$, $g_{Z_\pm}$ from $ZZ$ fusion, and $g_I$ from the interference term 
between fusion and Higgs--strahlung \cite{ZZH-Kilian}
\begin{equation}\label{totalZZ}
  \frac{d\sigma(\ee \to He^+e^-)}{dE_H\,d\cos\theta}
  = \frac{G_\mu^3 M_Z^8p_H}{\sqrt2\,\pi^3s}
  \left(g_S + g_I + g_{Z+} + g_{Z-} \right)
\end{equation}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
  g_S &=& \frac{\left(\hat{v}_e^2+\hat{a}_e^2\right)^2}{192}\;
    \frac{ss_e + s_1s_2}{\left(s-M_Z^2\right)^2

  \hat{a}_e^2}{64}\;

                \left[(s_e-M_Z^2)^2 + M_Z^2\Gamma_Z^2\right]} {\cal H}_I
    \nonumber\\
  g_{Z+} &=& \frac{\left(\hat{v}_e^2+\hat{a}_e^2\right)^2+4\hat{v}_e^2
 \hat{a}_e^2} {32\, s_1 s_2 r}\, {\cal H}_+    \ , \
  g_{Z-} = \frac{\left(\hat{v}_e^2-\hat{a}_e^2\right)^2}{32\, s_1 s_2 r}\,
        (1 - c_\chi){\cal H}_-
\end{eqnarray}
where the same abbreviations as in the formulas for the $W$ fusion case, with
the appropriate replacements, $\nu\to e$ and $W\to Z$, have been used. Again, 
the three components and the total cross sections follow the same trend as in 
the case of the $WW$ fusion process. \s

The calculation of the one--loop  radiative corrections to this process follows
the same lines as the one for the companion process $\ee \to H \nu \bar{\nu}$,
the only difference being that there are additional diagrams where photons are
exchanged between the initial and final state electrons and positrons, and also
between the final state $\ee$ pair. The corrections have been calculated using
the {\tt GRACE-LOOP} \cite{GRACE} system, and the result has recently appeared 
in Ref.~\cite{RCZZ}. They are summarized in Fig.~4.15 as a function of $\sqrt 
s$  for three Higgs mass values.\s

After subtracting the photonic corrections which decrease the cross section by
about 5\% for $\sqrt{s} \gsim 350$ GeV, as shown in the left--hand side of 
the figure, one obtains a rather small electroweak correction: when the 
tree--level cross section is expressed in terms of $G_\mu$, the correction is 
${\cal O}(-5\%)$ at $\sqrt{s}=350$--500 GeV and varies very little with energy 
to reach $-4\%$ at 1 TeV, as can be seen in the right--hand side of Fig.~4.15. 
The correction is also almost independent of the Higgs mass in the chosen 
range, $M_H \sim 100$--200 GeV. The correction factor when $\alpha$ 
is used as input at the tree--level is also shown.\s

For the process $e^+e^-\to He^+e^-$, the pattern for the polarized and 
unpolarized cross sections is slightly more complicated than for the $WW$ 
fusion process \cite{ZZH-Kilian}
\begin{eqnarray}
  \sigma_U &\propto&
	g_S + g_I + g_{Z+} + g_{Z-}\ , \  \sigma_{LL} = \sigma_{RR} \propto
	2\,g_{Z-} \non \\
  \sigma_{LR/RL} &\propto&
	2\frac{(\hat v_e\pm \hat a_e)^2}{(\hat v_e^2+\hat a_e^2)}g_S
	+ 2\frac{(\hat v_e\pm\hat a_e)^4}{(\hat v_e^2+\hat a_e^2)^2+4\hat 
        v_e^2 \hat a_e^2}
	\left(g_I + g_{Z+}\right) \non 
\end{eqnarray}
Since $\hat v_e \sim -1+4s_W^2 \ll \hat a_e$, the difference between 
$\sigma_{RL}$ and $\sigma_{LR}$ is, however, strongly suppressed and one 
obtains $\sigma_{LR} \simeq \sigma_{LR}= 2 (g_S+ g_I+ g_{Z_+})$.\s
 
Finally, let us note that in the $e^-e^-$ option of future high--energy linear 
colliders, one can produce Higgs bosons in a similar channel \cite{VVH-Hikasa}
\beq
e^- e^- \lra e^- e^- (Z^*Z^*) \lra e^- e^- H
\eeq
The production cross section [up to some statistical factors due to the 
identical initial and final states] and the main features of the process are 
the same as those discussed above for the $\ee$ option of the machine.

\subsubsection{Associated production with heavy fermion pairs}

\subsubsection*{\underline{The process at the tree--level}}

In the SM, the associated production of Higgs bosons with a pair of heavy 
fermions, $\ee \to H f \bar{f}$ \cite{ee-ttH0,ee-ttH}, proceeds through two 
set of diagrams: those
where the Higgs boson is radiated off the $f$ and $\bar{f}$ lines, and a 
diagram where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a $Z$ boson 
which then splits into an $f\bar{f}$ pair; Fig.~4.16.\\[-1.2cm]

Since  the fermion and Higgs boson masses must be kept non--zero, the total 
cross section for these processes is quite involved. However, the Dalitz  
density, once the angular dependence is integrated out, can be written in a 
simple and compact form \cite{ee-ttH}
\beq
\frac{{\rm d}\sigma (\ee \to f\bar{f}H)}{{\rm d}x_1 {\rm d}x_2} =
\frac{\bar{\alpha}^2 N_c}{12 \pi s} \hspace*{-4mm} & & \left\{ \left[
Q_e^2 Q_f^2 + \frac{2 Q_e Q_f {v}_e {v}_f}{1-z}+\frac{( {v}_e^2

\sum_{i=2}^{6} G_i + {v}_f^2 (G_4+G_6) \right] + \frac{Q_e Q_f {v_e}
{v}_f}{1-z} G_6 \right\} \non
\label{ttHxsection}
\eeq
with $\bar{\alpha} \equiv \alpha(s) \sim 1/128$, $N_c$ the color factor and 
${v}_e, {a}_e$ the usual couplings of fermions to the $Z$ boson,
eq.~(\ref{Zffcouplings}).  $z$ is the scaled mass of the $Z$ boson, $z=M_Z^2/s$,
and we will use later on the scaled masses $f =m_f^2/s$ and $h=M_H^2/s$.  $x_1=2
E_f/\sqrt{s}$ and $x_2=2E_{\bar{f}}/ \sqrt{s}$ are the reduced energies  of the
$f$ and $\bar{f}$ states; we will also use the Higgs scaled energy,
$x_H=2E_H/\sqrt{s}=2-x_1-x_2$, as well as  the variables $x_Z$ and $x_{12}$ 
defined by $x_Z=x_H-1-h+z$ and $x_{12}=(1-x_1) (1-x_2)$. In terms of these
variables and the $g_{Hff}=m_t/v$ and  $g_{HZZ}=2M_Z/v$ Higgs couplings,
the coefficients $G_i$,  with $i=1$--6, are given by 
\beq
G_1 &=& \frac{g_{Hff}^2}{x_{12}} \bigg[ x_H^2 - h \bigg( \frac{x_H^2}{x_{12}}
+ 2 (x_H -1-h) \bigg) + 2f \bigg(  4(x_H-h) + \frac{x_H^2}{x_{12}} (4f -h+2)
\bigg) \bigg] \non \\
G_2 &=&  - 2 \frac{g_{Hff}^2}{x_{12}} \bigg[ x_{12}(1+x_H)  - h (x_{12}
+ 2x_H + 8f -2h)  + 3f x_H \bigg( \frac{x_H}{3} +4 + \frac{x_H}{x_{12}} 
(4f -h) \bigg) \bigg] \non \\
G_3 &=& 2 \frac{g_{HZZ}^2}{x_Z^2} \bigg[ f(4h-x_H^2-12z)+ \frac{f}{z} 
( 4h -x_H^2) (x_H-1-h+z) \bigg] \non \\
G_4 &=& 2 \frac{g_{HZZ}^2}{x_Z^2} z \bigg[ h +x_{12} + 2(1-x_H)+4f) \bigg]
\non \\
G_5 &=& - \frac{g_{Hff} g_{HZZ}}{x_{12} x_Z} \, 4 x_H \frac{m_f}{M_Z}\, 
\bigg[ (x_{12} -h) (x_H-1-h) + f(12z-4h+x_H^2)  - 3z \bigg( h- 2\frac{x_{12}}
{x_H} \bigg) \bigg] \non \\
G_6 &=& - \frac{g_{Hff} g_{HZZ}}{x_{12} x_Z} \, 4 z \frac{m_f}{M_Z}\,
\bigg[ x_H(h-4f-2) -2x_{12} + x_H^2  \bigg]
\eeq
Integrating over the fermion energies, with the boundary conditions similar to 
that given in eq.~(\ref{eq:dalitzbound}), one obtains the total production 
cross section. In the case of $\ee \to t\bar{t}H$, it is shown in Fig.~4.17 as 
a function of $M_H$ for three c.m. energy values $\sqrt{s}=0.5, 1$ and 3 TeV. 


\begin{figure}[!h]

\nn {\it Figure 4.17: The cross section for the associated production of the

with the Higgs radiated off the top quark lines is taken into account.} 
\vspace*{-.3cm}
\end{figure}

While the cross section is in general small for the lowest  c.m. energy
$\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV, it is more important at $\sqrt{s}=1$ TeV as a result of the
larger available phase--space. For $\sqrt{s}=3$ TeV, it becomes  again smaller
as it scales like $1/s$. The cross section is at the  level of a few to a
fraction of a femtobarn, depending on the Higgs mass and the  c.m.  energy and
therefore, this process requires high--luminosities.  The $t\bar{t}H$ final
state in this associated production mechanism is generated almost exclusively
through Higgs--strahlung off top quarks. As shown in Fig.~4.17, the additional
contributions from Higgs bosons emitted by the $Z$ line are very small,
amounting, for $\sqrt{s} \leq 1$ TeV,  to only a few percent. In addition,
since top quark pair production in $\ee$ collisions at high energy is known to
be dominated by photon exchange, the bulk of the cross section is generated by
the $\ee \to \gamma^* \to t\bar{t}H$ subprocess.  This process thus allows the
determination of the important Yukawa coupling of the Higgs boson to top quarks
in an almost unambiguous way.

\vspace*{-2mm}
\subsubsection*{\underline{The radiative corrections}}

The QCD corrections to the process  $\ee \to t\bar{t}H$, consist of the top
vertex and self--energy corrections and the emission of an additional gluon in
the final state, $\ee \to t\bar{t}H+g$. The rather involved analytical
expression of the cross section at NLO can be found in
Refs.~\cite{RCTTqcd1,RCTTqcd2}; see also Refs.~\cite{RCTTew1,RCTTew2}. The 
corrections can be interpreted in an easy way and be given analytically in two 
kinematical regimes \cite{RCTTqcd1}.  

$(i)$ In the case where the invariant $t\bar{t}$ mass is close to the threshold,
the rescattering diagrams generated by the gluon exchange between the two
quarks gives rise to a correction that is proportional to $\alpha_s/\beta_t$, 
where $\beta_t$ is the top quark velocity which vanishes at the threshold in 
the $t\bar{t}$ rest frame. The $K$--factor in this case is given by
\cite{RCTTqcd1}
\beq
K^{\rm thresh}_{\ee \to t\bar{t}H}= 1 + 64 \alpha_s/(9\pi) \, \pi m_t \, 
\left[ (\sqrt{s}-M_H^2)^2 -4m_t^2 \right]^{-1/2}  
\eeq
This pole is regularized by the vanishing phase--space at threshold in the 
leading order cross section, once it is integrated over the 3--body phase 
space. \s

$(ii)$ At high energies, these rescattering corrections become less important.
For the dominant component of the $\ee \to t\bar{t}H$ process, i.e. Higgs
radiation off top quarks, the correction can be crudely estimated in the
limit $s \gg m_t^2 \gg M_H^2$: the radiation of a low mass Higgs boson can be 
separated from the top quark production process. The cross section can then 
be approximated by the product of the probability of producing top quark pairs 
[which at high energies, is given by the well--known factor $1+ \alpha_s/\pi$]  
and the probability for the splitting processes $t \to t+H$ and $\bar{t} 
\to \bar{t}H$ [which at this order, gives a factor $-2\alpha_s$ for each 
state]. The net result will be then an NLO coefficient factor \cite{RCTTqcd1}
\beq
K^{\rm high-en.}_{\ee \to t\bar{t}H}= 1 - 3\alpha_s/\pi
\eeq
leading to a correction factor, $K \sim 0.9$ at high energies. The QCD
correction factor is shown in Fig.~4.18 as a function of the c.m. 
energy for $M_H=150$ GeV. \s

The electroweak corrections have been calculated only recently by two of the
groups that evaluated the correction to the $WW$ fusion process
\cite{RCTTew1,RCTTew2}.  The calculation's techniques are the same as those
discussed previously.  [There is a third calculation performed in
Ref.~\cite{RCTTew0} but the results differ from those of the two other 
calculations at large c.m. energies and at the threshold.] The results are 
also shown in Fig.~4.18  together with the QCD corrections, as a function of 
the c.m. energy and for $M_H=150$ GeV.\s

As can be seen, the weak bosonic corrections are at the level of
$+10\%$  close to the $2m_t+M_H$ threshold and drop rapidly with increasing
energy to reach $-20\%$ at $\sqrt{s}=1.5$ TeV. The fermionic corrections are
approximately $+10\%$ over the entire energy range.  The QED corrections, which
include the full photonic and the higher--order ISR corrections are large and
negative near threshold and rise with the energy to reach a few percent at
$\sqrt{s}=1.5$ TeV. At energies above $\sqrt{s} \sim 600$ GeV, the fermionic, 
weak bosonic and QED contributions partly cancel each other, leading to a total
electroweak correction that is almost constant and of the order of $-10\%$.
This is of the same order as the QCD correction far enough from the production
threshold.  The total cross section at NLO, in which both the QCD and 
electroweak corrections are included, is thus 10 to 15\% smaller than at 
tree--level for $\sqrt{s}\gsim 750$ GeV; see the right--hand side of 
Fig.~4.18.

energy for $M_H = 150$ GeV; from Ref.~\cite{RCTTew1}.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{\underline{The pseudoscalar case and the Higgs CP properties}}

If the Higgs boson were of pseudoscalar nature, with couplings to fermions as 
given in eq.~(\ref{Affcp}), the dominant contribution to the cross section of 
the process $\ee\to f\bar{f}A$ would be also due to the Higgs radiation off the 
heavy fermion that are produced mainly through photon exchange. The expression 
of the Dalitz density ${\rm d} \sigma(\ee \to f\bar{f}A)/{\rm d}x_1 {\rm d} x_2$
will be still as in eq.~(\ref{ttHxsection}), with the coefficients $G_1$ and 
$G_2$ given by [here $a=M_A^2/s$] \cite{ee-ttH,ee-ttA}
\beq
G_1 &=& \frac{g_{Aff}^2}{x_{12}} \bigg[ x_A^2 - a \bigg( \frac{x_A^2}{x_{12}}
(1+2f) +2(x_A -1 -a) \bigg) \bigg] \non \\
G_2 &=&  -2 \frac{g_{Aff}^2}{x_{12}} \bigg[ x_{12}(1+ x_A)-a(x_{12}-4f+2x_A-2a)
 + f \frac{x_A^2}{x_{12}} (x_{12}-3a ) \bigg] 
\eeq
while the contributions of $G_{3}$--$G_6$ can be neglected [note that, in
two--Higgs doublet models, additional contributions to this process might come 
from other channels]. As can be seen, because the top quark is massive, 
the Dalitz density is different from the CP--even Higgs case by terms of
${\cal O}(m_t^2/s)$ which, for moderate c.m. energies, are not that small. 
This feature provides an additional means to discriminate between a scalar
and a pseudoscalar Higgs boson and even, to probe CP violation in the 
$t\bar{t}$--Higgs couplings when both components are present; for a detailed 
discussion, see Ref.~\cite{ee-ttHspin}.\s

If one assumes general Higgs couplings to top quarks compared to the SM, ${\cal
L} (Htt) = (a+ib \gamma_5) g_{Htt}$ [and also to the $Z$ boson, ${\cal L} (HZZ)
= c g_{HZZ} g_{\mu \nu}$, when the diagram $\ee \to HZ^*$ with $Z^* \to t
\bar{t}$ is included, since its contribution needs not to be small relative to
the dominant ones in extensions of the SM], one would have a rather involved
dependence of the $\ee \to t\bar{t}H$ cross section on the phase space.  The
differential cross section can be written in a general form as d$\sigma/$d$\Phi
= \sum_i d_i f_i(\Phi)$, where $\Phi$ is the final state phase--space
configuration and $d_i$ are combinations of the Higgs coupling parameters
$a,b,c$ [in the SM, only the combinations $d_i\!=\! a^2,ac$ and $c^2$ will be
present with $a\!=\!c\!=\!1$]. An optimal technique has been proposed in
Ref.~\cite{ee-ttHspin} for determining the coefficients $d_i$ of the cross
section by using appropriate weighting functions $w_i(\Phi)$ such that $\int
\omega_i (d\sigma/d\Phi)=d_i$, with the additional requirement that the
statistical error in the extraction of the coefficients is minimized.  

\subsubsection{Higgs boson pair production}

To establish the Higgs mechanism experimentally, once the Higgs particle is
discovered, the characteristic self--energy potential of the SM  must be 
reconstructed. This task requires the measurement of the trilinear and
quartic self--couplings of the Higgs boson, $\lambda_{HHH}=3 M_H^2/v$ 
and  $\lambda_{HHHH}=3 M_H^2/v^2$. The trilinear Higgs coupling can be 
measured directly in pair production of Higgs particles in $\ee$ collisions 
and several mechanisms can be exploited. Higgs pairs can be produced 
through double Higgs--strahlung off $Z$ bosons 
\cite{ee-HHZ,HH-Barger,ee-DKMZ,ee-H3-pheno}
\beq 
\ee \to Z^* \lra ZHH
\eeq
and vector boson [mostly $W$ boson] fusion into two Higgs bosons 
\cite{pp-VVHH,HH-Barger,ee-DKMZ}
\beq
\ee \to V^* V^* \lra \ell \ell HH
\eeq 
The Feynman diagrams for the two processes are shown in Fig.~4.19 and, as can 
be seen, one of them involves the triple Higgs interaction. The other
diagrams  are generated by the gauge interactions familiar
from single Higgs production in the dominant processes.\s

The complete reconstruction of the SM Higgs potential requires the measurement 
of the quadrilinear coupling $\lambda_{HHHH}$ which can be accessed directly 
only through the production of three Higgs bosons, $\ee \ra ZHHH$ and $\ee \ra
\bar{\nu}_e \nu_e HHH$.  However, these cross  sections are reduced by two to
three orders of magnitude compared to the  corresponding double Higgs production
channels, and are therefore too  small to be observed at future $\ee$ 
colliders even with the large luminosities which are planned [see \S4.3.4].  

\vspace*{-3.mm}
\subsubsection*{\underline{The double Higgs--strahlung}}

The differential cross section for the process of double Higgs-strahlung, $\ee 
\to ZHH$, after the angular dependence is integrated out, can be cast into

\frac{(\hat a_e^2 + \hat v_e^2)}{(1- \mu_Z)^2}\, {\cal Z} 
\eeq 
where the electron--$Z$ couplings are defined as usual, 
eq.~(\ref{Zffcouplings}). 
$x_{1,2} =2 E_{1,2}/\sqrt{s}$ are the scaled energies of the two Higgs
particles, $x_3 = 2 - x_1 -x_2$ is the scaled energy of the $Z$ boson, and we
define $y_i = 1 - x_i$; the scaled masses are denoted by $\mu_i = M_i^2/s$. In
terms of these variables, the coefficient ${\cal Z}$ may be written as
\beq 
{\cal Z}\!&\!=\!&\!\frac{1}{8} a^2 f_0 +
\frac{1}{4 \mu_Z (y_1+\mu_H -\mu_Z)} \left[

\eeq
The first term in the coefficient $a$ includes the scaled trilinear coupling 
$\lambda_{HHH}'=3 M_H^2/M_Z^2$. The other terms are related to 
sequential Higgs--strahlung and the 4 gauge--Higgs boson coupling; the
individual terms can easily be identified by examining the propagators.\s

The production cross section, which is a binomial in the self--coupling
$\lambda_{HHH}$,  is shown in Fig.~4.20 as a function of the Higgs mass for
three c.m. energies $\sqrt{s} = 0.5,1$ and 3 TeV. It is of the order of  a
fraction of a femtobarn when it is not too much suppressed by phase--space and,
because it is mediated by $s$ channel gauge boson exchange and scales like
$1/s$, it is higher at lower energies for moderate Higgs masses.  In addition,
since the process is mediated by $Z$--boson exchange, the cross section is
doubled if oppositely polarized electron and positron beams are used. The cross
section 
for the $ZHH$ final state is rather sensitive to the $\lambda_{HHH}$ coupling: 
for $\sqrt{s}\!=\!500$ GeV and $M_H\!=\!120$ GeV for instance, it varies by 
about 20\% for a 50\% variation of the trilinear coupling as shown in the 
figure.

\vspace*{-.3cm}
\end{figure}

The one--loop radiative corrections to the double Higgs--strahlung process are
also very involved to calculate since, already at the tree--level, one has to
deal with three massive particle in the final state and, thus, one has to
consider pentagonal diagrams and four--body finals states at NLO. They have
again been calculated recently by two independent groups \cite{RCZHH1,RCZHH2},
with results that agree reasonably, in particular at low energies. The QED
corrections follow the same trend as what has been observed in the case of the
$\ee \to t\bar{t}H$ process for $M_H=150$ GeV: they are very large and negative
for c.m.  energies near the production threshold, $\sim -40\%$ at $\sqrt{s}
\sim 400$ GeV, and decrease in absolute value to reach the level of a few
percent above $\sqrt{s} \sim 600$ GeV, $\sim +5\%$ at 1.5 TeV; see the left
panel of Fig.~4.21.  For the pure weak corrections, when calculated using
$\alpha$ in the Born term, they are rather small not exceeding $\sim +5\%$ near
the threshold and at moderate c.m. energies when the cross section is maximal;
see the right panel of Fig.~4.21. At higher energies, the weak corrections turn
negative and increase in size to reach $\sim -10\%$ at $\sqrt{s}=1.5$ TeV. The
weak corrections calculated in the IBA are also shown (dotted lines). As in the
case of the $\ee \to HZ$ parent process, this approximation fails to reproduce
the magnitude of the weak corrections, especially at high energies. The
approximate top quark mass correction to the Higgs self--coupling does also not
reproduce the bulk of the weak correction.

Note that the correction to the invariant mass distribution of the Higgs pair,
which can be a means to isolate the $HHH$ vertex since the two Higgs bosons 
originate from the decay of an off--shell scalar particle \cite{gam-WWHH},
has also been calculated and found to be small. 


\vspace*{-2mm}
\subsubsection*{\underline{The $WW$ fusion process}}

At high energies, double Higgs boson production in the $WW$ fusion channel,
$\ee \to \nu \bar{\nu}HH$ \cite{pp-VVHH,HH-Barger}, provides the largest cross 
section for  Higgs bosons in the intermediate mass range, in particular when the
initial beams are polarized. [Again, the $ZZ$ fusion channel has a cross section
that is one order of magnitude smaller compared to $WW$ fusion as a 
result of the smaller $Z$ couplings to electrons]. The cross
section for this four--particle final state is very involved but it can be
roughly estimated in the equivalent $W$ boson approximation, $WW \to HH$. 
Taking into account only the dominant longitudinal $W$ contribution, denoting
by $\beta_{W,H}$ the $W,H$ boson velocities in the c.m.\ frame, we define the
variable $x_W = (1- 2 M_H^2/\hat{s})/(\beta_W \beta_H)$ with  $\hat{s}^{1/2}$
is the invariant energy of the $WW$ pair.  The amplitude ${\cal M}_{LL}$ has
been given in eq.~(\ref{WW--HHamp}) when this process was discussed at hadron
colliders and, integrating out the angular dependence, the corresponding total
cross section reads \cite{ee-DKMZ,gam-WWHH} 
\beq
\hat{\sigma}_{LL} &=& \frac{G_F^2 M_W^4}{4\pi \hat{s}} \frac{\beta_H}
{\beta_W (1-\beta_W^2)^2} \Bigg\{ (1+\beta_W^2)^2 \left[1 + 
\frac{\lambda_{HHH}'}
{(\hat{s} -M_H^2)/M_Z^2} \right]^2 \non\\
& + &\frac{16}{(1+\beta_H^2)^2-4\beta_H^2 \beta_W^2} 
\left[ \beta_H^2(

 + (1+\beta_W^2 -\beta_W^4)^2 \right] \non \\
& + &\frac{1}{\beta_W^2 \beta_H^2} \left( \ell_W +
 \frac{2x_W} {x_W^2-1} \right) 
 \left[ \beta_H ( \beta_H x_W-4\beta_W) (1+ \beta_W^2-
\beta_W^4 +3 x_W^2 \beta_H^2) \right. \non\\ 
&+& \left.  \beta_H^2 x_W 
(1-\beta_W^4 +13 \beta_W^2) 
- \frac{1}{x_W}(1+\beta_W^2-\beta_W^4)^2 \right] 
+  \frac{2(1+\beta_W^2)}{ \beta_W \beta_H} 
\left[1 + \frac{\lambda_{HHH}}{(\hat{s} -M_H^2)/M_Z^2} \right] \non \\
&\times & \left[ \ell_W ( 1+\beta_W^2-\beta_W^4 -2\beta_W \beta_H x_W +
\beta_H^2 x_W^2)
 +2\beta_H (x_W \beta_H  -2\beta_W ) \right] 
\Bigg\} 
\eeq
with $ \ell_W = \log [(x_W-1)/(x_W+1)]$. After folding the cross section of the
subprocess with the longitudinal $W_L$ spectra given in eq.~(\ref{WW-spectra}),
one obtains the total $e^+ e^-$ cross section in the effective $W_LW_L$ 
approximation, which exceeds the exact value of the $\ee \to \nu \bar{\nu}HH$ 
cross section by  about a factor 2 to 5 depending on the collider energy and 
the Higgs mass. \s

\vspace*{-.1cm}
\end{figure}


The cross section is shown in Fig.~4.22 as a function of $M_H$ for $\sqrt{s}
=0.5,1$ and 3 TeV. As expected, the fusion cross sections increase with rising
energy.  Again, there is a significant variation of the cross section with a
variation of $\lambda_{HHH}$. The transverse components of the $W$ bosons give
rather small contributions through $W_T W_T \to HH$ for large Higgs masses.
Note that the ${\cal O}(\alpha)$ corrections have been also calculated using
{\tt GRACE-LOOP} and a preliminary result has appeared in Ref.~\cite{RCZZ}; the
corrections are of ${\cal O}(10\%)$.  


\subsubsection{Other subleading processes in $\ee$ collisions} 

Finally, there are other subdominant higher--order Higgs production processes:
the associated production with a photon, the loop induced as well as some 
tree--level higher--order double Higgs production, the associated Higgs 
production with gauge boson pairs and the associated production with two 
fermions and a gauge boson.  We briefly summarize the main features of 
these processes for completeness.

\vspace*{-2mm}
\subsubsection*{\underline{Higgs production in association with two gauge 
bosons}}

Similarly to what one observes at hadron colliders, in high--energy $\ee$ 
collisions, $W$ pair production, $\ee \to W^+W^-$, has a very large cross 
section. This
is also the case of $\ee \to ZZ$ and $Z \gamma$ production\footnote{As noted 
before, the process with the additional final state photon should be viewed 
as part of the radiative corrections to the Higgs--strahlung process [the same 
remark holds for the process $\ee \to \nu_e \bar{\nu}_e H\gamma$ to be 
discussed later, which is part of the QED correction to the $WW$ fusion 
mechanism]. However, this process can be discussed on its own since here 
the photon is required to be detected and the $\ee \to HZ\gamma$ process can 
have a comparable rate than the parent process which scales as $1/s$ at 
high  energies, as the ISR photon will decrease the effective c.m. energy.}, 
which are mediated by  $t$--channel electron exchange. It is thus 
tempting to take advantage of these large production rates and consider the 
emission of an additional  Higgs particle from one of the gauge boson  lines
\beq 
\ee \to W^+W^- H \  , \ ZZH \ , \ Z\gamma H 
\eeq
as shown in Fig.~4.23.  The hope is that the suppression by the additional 
electroweak factor might be compensated by the initially large production 
rates.

This turns out to be quite true \cite{ee-HVff,ee-HVV,DWP}: at least for the
process $\ee \to Z\gamma H$ [where one has to apply a cut on the transverse
momentum $p_T \gsim 5$ GeV of the photon] and for the $\ee \to W^+W^- H$
mechanism, the cross sections are quite sizable. At $\sqrt{s}= 800$ GeV and
for $M_H\sim 100$--200 GeV, they are at the level of a few fb as shown in
Fig.~4.24. With the expected luminosity ${\cal L}=$ 500 fb$^{-1}$, they could 
lead to more than 1000 events which are rather clean. For masses $M_H \sim 300$
GeV, they are still at the level of 1 fb, which is only one order of magnitude
smaller than the Higgs--strahlung process at these values of $M_H$ and
$\sqrt{s}$.  Again, as one might have expected, the production rate for the
$\ee \to ZZH$ process is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the  $\ee
\to WWH$ process. Note that the cross sections for these processes do not
become larger at higher energies. \s

Once the Higgs particle has been detected in the main channels, these processes
could be useful: in conjunction with the dominant Higgs--strahlung and $WW$
fusion processes, they would allow to test the quartic couplings involving
Higgs and gauge bosons and, for instance, to probe directly the $HZW^+W^-$ and
$H\gamma W^+W^-$ couplings and even, potentially, C--violating $HZZZ$ and
$H\gamma ZZ$ couplings which are absent in the SM.

Since, as previously discussed, the parent fusion processes $\ee \to H \ell
\ell$ have rather large production cross sections at high energies, one might
hope again that the emission of an additional gauge boson will still lead to a
reasonable event rate, similarly to the case of double Higgs boson production
in the vector boson fusion channels $\ee \to HH \ell \ell$ discussed in the
preceding section. These processes have been considered in
Ref.~\cite{ee-HVff} and are being updated \cite{DWP}. The cross sections for
$\ee \to \nu \bar \nu ZH$  and $\ee \to \nu e WH$ are shown in Fig.~4.26 as a
function of the c.m. energy for $M_H=160$ GeV.  As can be seen, they follow the
general trend of vector boson fusions mechanisms and increase with energy
and/or lower  Higgs masses.  They are quite sizable since, for $\ee \to \nu_e
e^\pm W^\mp H$, the cross section reaches almost the level of 10 fb at $\sqrt
s \sim 1$ TeV for $M_H \sim 120$ GeV. The cross section is a factor of $\sim 
5$ smaller in the case of the $\ee \to \nu_e \bar{\nu}_e Z H$ mechanism and is 
even smaller in the case of the $\ee \to \ee Z H$ process for which is not 
shown.

In the SM, the process where a Higgs boson is produced in association with a
photon, $\ee \to H\gamma$ \cite{ee-Hgamma}, proceeds through $s$--channel 
$\gamma^* \gamma H$
and $Z^* \gamma H$ vertex diagrams, but additional $t$--channel vertex and box
diagrams involving $W$/neutrino and $Z$/electron exchange also occur;
Fig.~4.27. The $s$--channel contributions involve the same form factors as the
effective couplings for the $H \to Z\gamma, \gamma \gamma$ decays discussed in
S2.3, but with one of the two photons  and the $Z$ boson being virtual, with an
effective mass $M_{Z^*}=\sqrt{s}$.\\[-1.cm]

Since it is a higher--order process in the electroweak coupling, the cross
section is rather small, $\sigma(\ee \to H\gamma) \sim 0.05$
fb for $M_H \sim100$--200 GeV at $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV. However, since the photon
is mono--chromatic, the signal is very clean  allowing for a reasonable hope to
isolate these events if enough luminosity is collected a future high--energy
colliders.  Note that the longitudinal polarization of both electron and
positron beams will increase the cross sections by about a factor of 4 compared
to the unpolarized case. This process would then allow  for an alternative way
to probe the induced $H\gamma \gamma$  and $HZ\gamma$ couplings and,
potentially, to probe the heavy particles involved in the loops.  

\vspace*{-2mm}
\subsubsection*{\underline{Loop induced double Higgs production}}

Due to CP invariance, the $ZHH$ coupling is absent in the SM and the  process
$\ee \to Z \to HH$ does not occur  at tree--level but only through  loop
contributions \cite{ee-HHloop}. Because of orbital  momentum conservation, the
amplitudes for the vertex diagrams with $s$--channel $\gamma$ and $Z$ bosons
giving rise to two $H$ bosons vanish [only the  contribution of the
longitudinal component of the $Z$ boson survives but it is proportional to the
electron mass and is thus negligible].  In addition, because of chiral symmetry
for $m_e=0$,  the diagrams  involving the $He^+e^-$ vertices give zero
contributions. The contribution of vertices involving the $HHVV$ interaction
give also contributions that are proportional to $m_e$ or $m_{\nu_e}$.
Therefore, in the SM, the process $\ee \to HH$ can be generated only through
box diagrams involving $W$/neutrino and $Z$/electron virtual states, Fig.~4.28.

Again, because of the additional electroweak factor, the production cross 
sections are rather small. Except when approaching the $M_H=2M_W$ 
threshold, where there is a small increase, the cross section is practically
constant and amounts to $\sim 0.2$ fb at $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV  for $M_H \sim
100$--200 GeV. With left--handed polarization of the electron beam, the cross 
section is increased by a factor of two, while for left--handed electrons and
right--handed positrons, it increases by a factor of four; these simple
factors are due to the fact that, as usual the contribution of the box with $W$ 
exchange is much larger than that with the $Z$ exchange. With a very high
luminosity, one might hope that the final state can be isolated. A deviation 
from the SM  expectation would signal a breakdown of CP--invariance or the
existence of new particles contributing to the loop diagrams. 

\subsubsection*{\underline{Higher order tree--level multi Higgs production}}

Finally, there are also higher--order processes for double Higgs production
which occur at the tree--level. Besides the $ZZ$ fusion process $\ee \to
HH \ee$ which, as mentioned previously, has a cross section that is one order 
of magnitude smaller than that of the $WW$ fusion process [for $M_H \sim 100$ 
GeV, the $\ee \to \ee HH$ cross section barely reaches the level of $\sim 0.1$ 
fb even at very high energies, $\sqrt s \sim 2$ TeV], one has the following 
reactions with $V=W,Z$ and $\ell=e,\nu_e$:
\beq
{\rm associated\ double\ Higgs\ production\ with\ two\ gauge\ bosons}
&:& \ee \lra VVHH \non  \\
%{\rm associated\ double\ Higgs\ production\ with\ two\ leptons}
%&:& \ee \lra \ell \ell HH \non \\
{\rm associated\ double\ Higgs\ production\ with\ t\bar t\ pairs}
&:& \ee \lra t \bar t HH

Some Feynman diagrams for these reactions [those which involve the trilinear
Higgs interaction] are displayed in Fig.~4.29. The production cross sections
for these processes have been calculated in
Refs.~\cite{ee-H3-Ilyn} using the package {\tt CompHEP}
\cite{Comphep} for the automatic evaluation of the full set of amplitudes and,
as expected, they are very small. The $\ee \to WWHH$ cross section is at the
level of 0.03 fb at $\sqrt s \sim 700$ GeV even for a Higgs mass as
low as $M_H \sim 65$ GeV, while the rate for $\ee \to ZZHH$ is again one
order of magnitude smaller. In the case of the 
$\ee \ra t \bar t HH$ process \cite{ee-H3-Ilyn,ee-H3-Sampayo}, the cross
section is at the level of $6\, (15)$ ab at a c.m. energy $\sqrt s =0.8\,
(1.6)$ TeV for $M_H\sim 130$ GeV and $m_t=175$ GeV. Thus, about 10 of such
events could be produced if very high luminosities, ${\cal L}\sim 1$ ab$^{-1}$,
can be collected at these energies. \s

In the case of triple Higgs production processes, which would allow for the
determination of the quartic Higgs coupling, the cross section are
unfortunately too small as mentioned earlier. In the $\ee \to ZHHH$ process
\cite{ee-DKMZ,ee-H3-Ilyn}, for instance, the signal amplitude squared involving
the four--Higgs coupling [as well as the irreducible Higgs--strahlung 
amplitudes]
is suppressed by a factor $[\lambda_{HHHH}^2/16\pi^2]/[\lambda_{HHH}^2/M_Z^2]
\sim 10^{-3}$ relative to $\ee \to ZHH$, not to mention the phase--space
suppression due to the additional final--state heavy particle. The cross
sections are below the atobarn level: $\sigma (HHHZ) \sim 0.44$ ab for $M_H
\sim 110$ GeV and $\sqrt s \sim 1$ TeV and are not very sensitive to a
variation of the self--coupling: $\sigma (HHHZ) \sim 0.41\, (0.46)$ ab when
$\lambda_{HHHH}$ is altered by a factor $\frac12 \, (\frac32)$ 
\cite{ee-DKMZ}.  The fusion
process $\ee \to HHH \nu \bar \nu$ has also a very small cross section, $\sigma
(HHH \nu \bar \nu) \sim 0.4$ ab at $\sqrt s =3$ TeV \cite{ee-H3-Battaglia}.

\subsection{Higgs studies in $\ee$ collisions}

In this section, we  summarize the precision tests of the SM Higgs sector
which can be performed at an $\ee$ machine operating in the 350--1000 GeV
energy range. We also briefly discuss the additional precision studies
which can be made by moving to higher energies at CLIC and by revisiting the
physics at the $Z$ resonance in the GigaZ option. We will almost exclusively
rely on the detailed studies which have been performed for the TESLA Technical
Design Report \cite{TESLA,LC-GigaZ} and on the very recent analyses of the CLIC
Physics working group \cite{CLIC}, since they involve realistic simulations of
the experimental environments\footnote{For the TESLA analyses in particular,
the backgrounds, the beamstrahlung and detector response have been taken into
account, generally using  programs such as {\tt CompHEP} \cite{Comphep} or {\tt
WHiZard} \cite{Whizard} in addition to the usual Monte-Carlo generators
\cite{PYTHIA,HERWIGee,HZHA}, {\tt Circe} \cite{Circe} and {\tt SIMDET}
\cite{Simdet} or {\tt BRAHMS} \cite{Brahms}; see Ref.~\cite{Ronan}.}.  We refer
to these two reports for more details and for more references on the original
work.  We will also mention some updated analyses which appeared
during the Linear Collider Workshops held in Amsterdam \cite{Desch} and Paris
\cite{LCWS}. Complementary material can be found in the reports of the American
Linear Collider working group \cite{NLC} and of the JLC working group
\cite{JLC}, as well as in the detailed reviews given in
Refs.~\cite{ee-Review-old,LHC-LC}.  


\subsubsection{Higgs boson signals}

As discussed in the previous sections, the main production mechanisms for SM
Higgs particles are the Higgs--strahlung process $\ee \to ZH$ and the $WW$
fusion process $\ee \to \bar{\nu}_e \nu_e H$. Subleading production channels
are the $ZZ$ fusion mechanism, $\ee \to \ee H$,  the associated production with
top quarks $\ee \to t\bar{t}H$ and double Higgs production in the strahlung
$\ee \to HHZ$ and fusion $\ee \to \bar{\nu} \nu HH$ processes which, despite
the small production rates, are very useful when it comes to the study of the 
Higgs properties. The other production processes, although some of them have
substantial cross sections such as $\ee \to HW^+W^-$ and  $\nu_e e^\pm W^\mp
H$, will not [at least in the context of the SM] provide any additional
information and we will ignore them in the following discussion.\s 

The cross sections have been given previously, but we summarize them again in
Fig.~4.30 for four c.m. energies $\sqrt{s}=350$ GeV, 500 GeV, 1 TeV and 3 TeV,
as functions of the Higgs mass. They have been obtained with the {\sc fortran}
code {\tt HPROD} \cite{HPROD}. We should mention that these cross sections do
not include the radiative corrections which have been discussed in this chapter
[except that we work in the IBA which absorbs some of the electroweak
corrections], and no photon ISR nor beamstrahlung effects have been taken into
account. However, since these corrections and effects are rather small, except
in peculiar regions of the phase space [such as for $\ee \to t\bar t H$ near
threshold and $\ee \to HZ$ at $\sqrt s \gg M_H$], these numbers approach the
exact results to better than 5 to 10\% depending on the process, and this
approximation is sufficient for most of the purposes that one can have before
the experiments actually start. In Table 4.3, we display the numerical values
of the cross sections for selected values of the Higgs mass at the two
different energies $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV and 1 TeV.\s

\vspace*{-3mm}
\end{table}

As previously mentioned, the Higgs--strahlung cross section scales as $1/s$ and
therefore dominates at low energies, while the one of $WW$ fusion mechanism
rises like $\log(s/M_H^2)$ and becomes more important at high energies. At
$\sqrt{s} \sim 500$ GeV, the two processes have approximately the same cross
sections, ${\cal O} (50~{\rm fb})$ for the interesting Higgs mass range 115 GeV
$\lsim M_H \lsim$ 200 GeV.  With an integrated luminosity ${\cal L} \sim 500$
fb$^{-1}$, as expected at the TESLA machine for instance, approximately 30.000
and 40.000 events can be collected in, respectively, the $HZ$ and $\nu \bar \nu
H$ channels for $M_H \sim 120$ GeV.  This sample is more than enough to observe
the Higgs particle and to study its properties in great detail.  \s

In the Higgs--strahlung process, the recoiling $Z$ boson, which can be tagged
through its clean $\ell^+ \ell^-$ decays, with $\ell=e$ or $\mu$, but also
through decays into quarks which have a much larger statistics, is
mono--energetic and the Higgs mass can be derived from the energy of the $Z$
boson since the initial $e^\pm$ beam energies are sharp when the effect of
beamstrahlung is strongly suppressed.  Therefore, it will be easy to separate
the signal from the backgrounds \cite{ee-HZ-backg,ee-HZ-backg1}. In the low
mass range, $M_H \lsim 140$ GeV, the process leads to $b\bar{b}q\bar{q}$ and
$b\bar{b}\ell \ell$ final states, with the $b$--quarks being efficiently tagged
by means of micro--vertex detectors. In the mass range where the decay $H \ra
WW^*$ is dominant, the Higgs boson can be reconstructed by looking at the $\ell
\ell + \,$4--jet or 6--jet final states, and using the kinematical constraints
on the fermion invariant masses which peak at $M_W$ and $M_H$, the backgrounds
are efficiently suppressed. Also the $\ell \ell q\bar q  \ell \nu$ and 
$q\bar q q\bar q  \ell \nu$ channels are easily accessible. \s

It has been shown in detailed simulations \cite{TESLA} that only a few
fb$^{-1}$ data are needed to obtain a 5$\sigma$ signal for a Higgs boson with a
mass $M_H \lsim 150$ GeV at a 500 GeV collider, even if it decays invisibly [as
could happen in some extensions of the SM].  In fact, for such small masses, it
is better to move to lower energies where the Higgs--strahlung cross section is
larger. Fig.~4.31 shows the reconstructed Higgs mass peaks in the strahlung
process at $\sqrt{s}=350$ GeV with a luminosity ${\cal L}=500$ fb$^{-1}$ for
$M_H=120$ GeV in the decay $H \to q\bar{q}$ and for $M_H=150$ GeV in the decay
$H \to WW^*$. At this energy and integrated luminosity, Higgs masses up to $M_H
\sim 260$ GeV can be probed in this channel.\s

Moving to higher energies, Higgs bosons with masses up to $M_H \sim 400$ GeV
can be discovered in the strahlung  process at an energy of 500 GeV and with
a luminosity of 500 fb$^{-1}$. For even higher masses, one needs to increase
the c.m. energy of the collider and, as a rule of thumb, Higgs masses up to
$\sim 80$\% $\sqrt{s}$ can be probed. This means that a 1 TeV collider can 
probe the entire SM Higgs mass range, $M_H \lsim 700$ GeV. Table 4.4 shows the 
maximal Higgs mass values which can be reached at various c.m. energies by 
requiring at least 50 signal events in the process $\ee\to HZ \to H\ell \ell$.\s

The $WW$ fusion mechanism offers a complementary production channel.  In the
low Higgs mass range where the decay $H\to b\bar{b}$ is dominant, flavor tagging
plays an important role to suppress the 2--jet plus missing energy background. 
The $\ee \to H\bar{\nu}\nu \to b\bar{b}\bar{\nu}\nu$ final state can be
separated from the corresponding one in the Higgs--strahlung process $\ee \to
HZ \to b\bar{b}\bar{\nu}\nu$ \cite{WWH-sep} by exploiting their different
characteristics in the $\nu \bar{\nu}$ invariant mass which are measurable
through the missing mass distribution; see Fig.~4.32. The polarization of the
electron and positron beams, which allow to switch on and off the $WW$ fusion
contribution, can be very useful to control the systematic uncertainties. \s
 
For larger Higgs boson masses, when the decays $H \to WW^{(*)},ZZ^{(*)}$ are
dominant, the main backgrounds are $WW(Z)$ and $ZZ(Z)$ production which have
large cross sections at high energies and eventually $t\bar t$, but again, they
can be suppressed using kinematical constraints from the reconstruction of the
Higgs mass peak. \s For even higher masses, when the Higgs boson decays into
$t\bar{t}$ final states, the $\ee \to t\bar{t}$ and $ t\bar{t} \ee$ backgrounds
can be reduced to a manageable level by exploiting the characteristics of the
$\nu \bar \nu b\bar b  WW$ signature.

\end{figure}

Turning to the subleading processes,  we have seen that the $ZZ$ fusion
mechanism has a cross section that is one order of magnitude smaller than $WW$
fusion, a result of the smaller neutral couplings compared to the charged
current couplings. However, the full final state can be reconstructed in this
case.  At c.m. energies above 1 TeV, the cross section exceeds the one of the
Higgs strahlung process so that $\ee \to H \ee$ can be used instead for model
independent searches by tagging the $\ee$ pair and reconstructing the missing
mass \cite{LCWS}. \s

The associated production with top quarks has a very small cross
section at $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV due to the phase space suppression but at
$\sqrt{s}=800$ GeV it can reach the level of a few femtobarn.  For $M_H \lsim
140$ GeV, the spectacular final state signal, $W^+W^- b\bar{b} b \bar{b}$, has
large backgrounds which can be suppressed by tagging the $b$--quarks and 
reconstructing the Higgs mass. The statistics are nevertheless very small 
and one has to resort to a neural network analysis to isolate the signal from
the remaining backgrounds. For higher Higgs masses, the final state 
$H t \bar t \to 4W b\bar b$ has also large backgrounds, which are nevertheless
manageable using again a neutral network. \s

The cross section for the double Higgs production in the strahlung process is
at the level of $\sim \frac12$ fb for a light Higgs at $\sqrt{s} =500$ GeV and 
is smaller at higher energies. The large backgrounds from four and six fermion
events can be suppressed for $M_H \lsim 140$ GeV by using the characteristic
signal of four $b$--quarks and a $Z$ boson, reconstructed in both leptonic an
hadronic final to increase the statistics, and using $b$--tagging. For higher
Higgs masses, the dominant final state is $Z+4W$.  In contrast, the cross
section for the $\ee \to \nu_e \bar{\nu}_e HH$ is extremely small at $\sqrt{s}
=500$ GeV but reaches the fb level at $\sqrt{s} =3$ TeV.  

\subsubsection{Precision measurements for a light Higgs boson}

Once the Higgs boson is found, it will be of great importance to explore all
its fundamental properties. This can be done at great details in the clean
environment of $\ee$ linear colliders: the Higgs boson mass, its spin  and
parity quantum numbers and its couplings to fermions, massive and massless
gauge bosons as well as its trilinear self--couplings can be measured with very
good accuracies. The measurements would allow to probe in all its facets  
the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. 

\vspace*{-2mm}
\subsubsection*{\underline{The Higgs boson mass}}
\vspace*{-1mm}

Many of the properties of the SM Higgs boson can be determined in a model
independent way by exploiting the recoil mass technique in the strahlung
process, $\ee \to HZ$.  The measurement of the recoil $\ee$ or $\mu^+ \mu^-$
mass in $\ee \ra ZH\ra H\ell \ell$, allows a very good determination of the
Higgs  mass \cite{meas-mass1,meas-mass2}. At $\sqrt{s}=350$ GeV and with a
luminosity of ${\cal L}= 500$ fb$^{-1}$, a precision of $ \Delta M_H \sim 70$
MeV can be reached for a Higgs mass of $M_H \sim 120$ GeV.  The precision can
be increased to $\Delta M_H \sim 40$ MeV by using in addition the hadronic
decays of the $Z$ boson which have more statistics \cite{meas-mass2}. 
Accuracies of the order of $\Delta M_H \sim 80$ MeV can also be reached for
$M_H$ values between 150 and 180 GeV when the Higgs boson decays mostly into
gauge bosons [see Ref.~\cite{LCWS1}, however].  The reconstructed Higgs mass
peak is shown in Fig.~4.33 at a 350 GeV collider in the two channels $HZ
\rightarrow b \bar b q \bar q$ for $M_H = 120$ GeV} and $HZ \rightarrow W^+W^-
q \bar q$ for $M_H=150$ GeV.  The obtained accuracy on $M_H$ is
a factor of two better than the one which could be obtained at the LHC.

\subsubsection*{\underline{The Higgs spin and parity}}
\vspace*{-1mm}

The determination of the $J^{\rm P}=0^{+}$ quantum number of the SM Higgs boson
can also be performed in the strahlung process. As discussed in \S4.2.1, the
measurement of the rise of the cross section near threshold, $\sigma (\ee \to
HZ) \propto \lambda^{1/2}$, rules out $J^{\rm P}=0^{-}, 1^{-}, 2^{+}$ and higher
spin $3^\pm,  \cdots$, which rise with higher powers of the velocity 
$\lambda^{1/2}$. A threshold scan with a luminosity of 20 fb$^{-1}$ at three
center of mass energies is sufficient to distinguish the various behaviors;
Fig.~4.34.  The production of states with the two remaining $J^{\rm P}=1^+,
2^-$ quantum numbers can be ruled out using the angular correlations of the
final state $\ee \to HZ \to 4f$.\s

The angular distribution of the $Z/H$ bosons in the Higgs--strahlung process is
also sensitive to the spin--zero of the Higgs particle: at high--energies, the
$Z$ is longitudinally polarized and the distribution follows the $\sim \sin^2
\theta$ law which unambiguously characterizes the production of a $J^P=0^+$
particle, since in the case of a pseudoscalar Higgs boson, the angular
distribution would behave as $1 +\cos^2\theta$. Assuming that the Higgs
particle is a mixed CP--even and CP--odd state with $\eta$ parameterizing the
mixture, the angular distribution given by eq.~(\ref{HZ:angular}) can be
checked experimentally. This is shown in the right--hand side of Fig.~4.34,
where one can see that the parameter $\eta$ can be measured to a precision of
3--4 percent, which is the typical size of electroweak radiative corrections
which, in CP--conserving models, could generate the CP--odd component of the
$ZZ\Phi$ coupling. Note that the Higgs $J^{\rm PC}$ quantum numbers can also be
checked by looking at correlations in the production $\ee \ra HZ \ra 4f$ or in
the decay $H \ra WW^*, ZZ^* \ra 4f$ processes, just as in the LHC case but with
more accuracy at the LC since one can use the larger hadronic modes of the $W$
and $Z$ bosons.\s

\end{figure}

The CP nature of the Higgs boson would be best tested in the couplings to 
fermions, where the scalar and pseudoscalar components might have comparable 
size. Such tests can be performed in the decay channel $H \ra \tau^+ \tau^-$ 
for $M_H \lsim 140$ GeV by studying the spin correlations between the final 
decay products of the two $\tau$ leptons \cite{CPHff1,CPHff2}. The 
acoplanarity angle between 
the decay planes of the two $\rho$ mesons produced from $\tau^+$ and $\tau^-$,
which can be reconstructed in the Higgs rest frame using the $\tau$ lifetime
information, is a very sensitive probe, allowing a discrimination between a 
CP--even and CP--odd state at the 95\% CL for $M_H=120$ GeV at the usual energy
and luminosity \cite{CPHff3}; using the additional information from the $\tau$ 
impact parameter significantly improves this determination. \s   

If the observed Higgs boson is a mixture of CP--even and CP--odd states, with
a coupling $g_{\Phi \tau \tau} =g_{H\tau \tau} (\cos\phi+ i\sin\phi \gamma_5)$
with $\phi=0$ in the SM Higgs case, the angular distributions in the $\tau^\pm 
\to \rho^\pm \nu$ decays allow to measure the mixing angle with an accuracy of $
\Delta \phi\sim 6^\circ$. This is shown in Fig.~4.35, which displays the 
distribution
of the acoplanarity angle $\varphi^*$ between the decay planes of the $\rho^+$
and $\rho^-$ in the rest frame of the pair, for several values of the mixing 
angle $\phi$,  as a result of a simulation for $\sqrt{s}=350$ GeV and  
${\cal L}=1$ ab$^{-1}$. \s

\end{figure}  

For heavier Higgs bosons, when the $H \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ becomes too small,
these studies cannot be performed anymore. A promising channel would be 
the decay $H \to t\bar{t}$ for $M_H >2m_t$, but no realistic simulation 
of the potential of this channel has been performed. 
Finally, and as discussed in \S4.3.2, the differential cross section in 
associated production with top quarks, $\ee \to t\bar t H$, is sensitive
to the CP nature of the Higgs boson, though no analysis has been performed 
to verify at which extent this information can be experimentally extracted. 

\newpage 
%\vspace*{-2mm}
\subsubsection*{\underline{The Higgs couplings to gauge bosons}}
\vspace*{-1mm}

The fundamental prediction that the Higgs couplings to $ZZ/WW$ bosons are
proportional to the masses of these particles can be easily verified 
experimentally since  these couplings can be directly determined by measuring 
the production cross sections in the bremsstrahlung and the fusion processes.  
$\sigma(\ee \ra HZ \to H \ell^+ \ell^-)$ can be measured by analyzing the recoil
mass against the $Z$ boson and provides a determination of the $g_{HZZ}$ 
couplings independently of the decay modes of the Higgs boson. Adding the
two lepton channels, one obtains a statistical accuracy of less than 3\%
at $\sqrt{s}\sim 350$ GeV and with $\int {\cal L}=500$ fb$^{-1}$ 
\cite{meas-mass1}. \s
       
The coupling $g_{HWW}$ for $M_H\lsim 2M_W$ can determined from the measurement
of the total cross section of the process $\ee \to W^* W^* \nu \bar \nu \to
H\nu \bar{\nu}$ which, as discussed previously, can be efficiently separated
from the $\ee \ra HZ \to H \nu \bar \nu$ channel and from the backgrounds, see
Fig.~4.32.  A precision of also less than 3\% can be achieved for $M_H=120$
GeV, but at a slightly higher energy, $\sqrt{s}\sim 500$ GeV, where the
production rate is larger \cite{meas-HWW}. The precision becomes worse for
increasing Higgs mass as a result of the falling cross section.\s

The accuracies which can be achieved are shown in Tab.~4.5 for three Higgs 
masses
and the precision on the Higgs couplings is half of these errors, since the
cross sections scale as $g_{HVV}^2$. Thus, a measurement of the Higgs couplings
to gauge bosons can be performed at the statistical level of 1 to 2\% and would
allow to probe the quantum corrections.

\subsubsection*{\underline{The Higgs decay branching ratios}}
\vspace*{-1mm}

The measurement of the branching ratios of the Higgs boson
\cite{BRs-early-studies,BRs-NLC,LCWS2,Brient,Barklow,ee-pp-ex,ee-pp-ex-G,ee-pZ-ex,ee-mu-ex
, ee-bb-ex,ee-Hinv-ex} is of utmost importance. For Higgs masses below $M_H
\lsim 150$ GeV a large variety of branching ratios can be measured at the
linear collider, since the $b\bar b, c\bar c$ and $gg$ final states can be very
efficiently disentangled by means of vertex detectors \cite{ZVTOP}. The
$b\bar{b}, c\bar{c}$  and $\tau^+ \tau^-$ fractions allow to measure the
relative couplings of the Higgs boson to these fermions and to check the
prediction of the Higgs mechanism that they are indeed proportional to fermion
masses. In particular, BR$(H \ra \tau^+ \tau^-) \sim m_{\tau}^2/3\bar{m}_b^2$
allows such a test in a rather clean way.  The gluonic branching ratio is
indirectly sensitive to the $t\bar{t}H$ Yukawa coupling and would probe the
existence of new strongly interacting particles that couple to the Higgs and
which are too heavy to be produced directly.  The branching ratio of the loop
induced $\gamma \gamma$ and $Z\gamma$ Higgs decays are also very sensitive to
new heavy particles and their measurement is thus very important. The branching
ratio of the Higgs decays into $W$ bosons starts to be significant for $M_H
\gsim 120$ GeV and allows to measure again the $HWW$ coupling in an independent
way. In the mass range 120 GeV $\lsim M_H \lsim 180$  GeV, the $H \to ZZ^*$
fraction is too small to be precisely measured, but for higher masses it is
accessible and allows an additional determination of the $HZZ$ coupling. \s

There are two methods to measure the Higgs branching ratios: first by measuring
the event rate in the Higgs--strahlung process for a given final state 
configuration and then dividing by the total cross section which is measured
from the recoil mass, and second, by selecting a sample of unbiased events in 
the $\ee \to HZ$ recoil mass peak and determining the fraction of events 
corresponding to a given final state decay. The first case, which is called the 
indirect method, has been used to study the Higgs branching ratios for the
TESLA TDR \cite{TESLA,LCWS2} while the second one, called the direct method,
appeared only recently \cite{Brient}. Both methods give rather similar results
but, since they are almost independent, these results may be combined to 
provide a significant improvement of the expected accuracies. \s

Ref.~\cite{TESLA}.}
\vspace*{2.mm}

The expected accuracies on the Higgs branching fractions are shown in Fig.~4.36
and in Table 4.6 [the low--energy (LE) numbers at the left] mostly at 
$\sqrt{s}=350$ GeV and with 500 fb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity for $M_H \leq 
160$ GeV. The $b\bar{b}, c\bar{c}, \tau^+ \tau^-,gg$ and $WW$ branching ratios 
of the Higgs boson can be measured with a very good accuracy. For the mass 
value $M_H=120$ GeV and using the indirect method, one obtains an accuracy of,
respectively, 2.4\%, 8.3\%, 5\%, 5.5\% and 5.1\%. When combined with the direct 
method measurements labeled LE(D), the errors decrease quite significantly. The
uncertainties in the measurements become larger when approaching the $WW$ 
threshold: at $M_H \sim 160$ GeV, only the $b\bar b, WW$ and $ZZ$ fractions are 
accessible, with still a poor accuracy in the latter case.
For $M_H \sim 200$ GeV, a higher energy $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV is needed to
compensate for the falling cross section, and the precision is good only
for the $WW$ and $ZZ$ channels. For the $H\to b\bar b$ decays, an energy of 
800 GeV and 1 ab$^{-1}$ data are required to reach the quoted precision of
17\%. \s

\vspace*{-2mm}
\end{table*}

In the low Higgs mass range, even the rare decays into $\gamma \gamma$ and $Z
\gamma$ final states can be measured with an accuracy of approximately 5 to 20\%
\cite{ee-pp-ex,ee-pZ-ex,Barklow}. The very rare decay into muon pairs is also
measurable, though with a rather poor accuracy, by going to high energies and
taking advantage of the enhanced production rates in $\ee \to H\nu \bar \nu$
\cite{ee-mu-ex}. A luminosity of 1 ab$^{-1}$ is necessary to probe all these
rare decay modes of the Higgs boson.\s

Finally, invisible Higgs decays can also be probed with a 
very good accuracy, thanks to the missing mass technique. One can also look 
directly for the characteristic signature of missing energy and momentum.
Recent studies show that in the range 120 GeV $\lsim M_H \lsim$ 160 GeV, 
an accuracy of $\sim 10\%$ can be obtained on a invisible decay with a branching
ratio of 5\% and a $5\sigma$ signal can be seen for a branching ratio as low 
as 2\% \cite{ee-Hinv-ex}.\s

Moving to higher energies, $\sqrt{s}=1$ TeV, the larger rate for 
the $WW$ fusion process helps improving the accuracy on the main decay 
branching ratios and even search for rare decays 
[as it was the case for $H\to \mu^+ \mu^-$]. In the right--hand side of 
Table 4.6, the HE numbers stand for measurements performed at this energy 
and with 1 ab$^{-1}$ data, when combined with the respective 
measurements at low energies \cite{Barklow}. As can be seen the accuracy on 
some decay branching ratios, in particular BR$(H\to b\bar{b}, \gamma \gamma)$, 
can be significantly improved. 

\subsubsection*{\underline{The Higgs total decay width}}
\vspace*{-1mm}

The total decay width of the Higgs boson, for $M_H \gsim 200$ GeV, is large 
enough to be accessible directly from the reconstruction of the Higgs  boson 
lineshape. For smaller Higgs masses, the total decay is less than 1 GeV and it
cannot be resolved experimentally.  However, it can be determined indirectly by
exploiting the relation between the total and partial decay widths for some
given final states. For instance, in the decay $H\to WW^*$, the total decay
width is given by $\Gamma_H = \Gamma(H \to WW^*)/{\rm BR}(H \to WW^*)$.
One can then combine the direct measurement of the $H \to WW^*$ branching ratio
discussed above and use the information on the $HWW$ coupling from the $WW$
fusion cross section to determine the partial decay width $\Gamma (H\to WW^*)$. 
Alternatively, on can exploit the measurement of the $HZZ$ coupling from the 
production cross section of the Higgs--strahlung process, since the mass reach
is higher than in $WW$ fusion,  and assume SU(2) invariance to relate the two 
couplings, $g_{HWW}/g_{HZZ} = 1/\cos\theta_W$. The accuracy on the total decay
width measurement follows then from that of the $WW$ branching ratio and the
$g_{HWW}$ coupling. 

\begin{table}[hbt]
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}

improvement which can be obtained when combining these results with those
which can be extracted from measurements at $\sqrt{s}\sim 1$ TeV with $\int 
{\cal L}=1$ ab$^{-1}$ \cite{Barklow}.}
\vspace{-.3cm}
\end{table}

As shown in Tab.~4.7, in the range 120 GeV $\lsim M_H \lsim$ 160 GeV, an 
accuracy  ranging from 4\% to 13\% can be achieved on $\Gamma_H$ if the
$HWW$ coupling is measured in the fusion process. This accuracy greatly
improves for higher $M_H$ values by assuming SU(2) universality which
allows to use the $HWW$ coupling as derived from the strahlung process.
If in addition a measurement of BR($H\to WW)$ is performed at higher energies
and combined with the previous values, the accuracy on the total Higgs width 
will greatly improve for high masses.\s

Note that the same technique would allow to extract the total Higgs decay 
width using the $\gamma \gamma$ decays of the Higgs boson together with 
the cross section from $\gamma \gamma \to H \to b\bar b$ as measured at a 
photon collider. This is particularly true since the measurement of BR($\gamma 
\gamma)$ at $\sqrt s \sim 1$ TeV is rather precise, allowing the total width 
to be determined with an accuracy of $\sim 5\%$ with this method for
$M_H=120$--140 GeV independently of the $WW$ measurement.


\vspace*{-.2cm}
\subsubsection*{\underline{The Higgs Yukawa coupling to top quarks}}

The Higgs Yukawa coupling to top quarks, which is the largest coupling in the
electroweak SM, is directly accessible in the process where the Higgs is
radiated off the top quarks, $\ee \ra t\bar{t}H$, since the contribution from
the diagram where the Higgs boson is radiated from the $Z$ line,  $\ee \to HZ
\to Ht\bar{t}$, is very small; Fig.~4.17. Because of the limited phase space,
this measurement can only be performed at high energies $\sqrt{s} \gsim 500$
GeV.  For $M_H \lsim 140$ GeV, the Yukawa coupling  can be measured in the
channel $W Wb\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ with the $W$ bosons decaying both leptonically
and hadronically to increase the statistics; $b$--tagging is essential in this
mass range \cite{Strasbourg,ee-ttH-exp}. For higher Higgs masses,  $M_H
\gsim 140$ GeV, the channels with $b\bar b+4W$ have to be considered, with
again, at least two $W$ bosons decaying hadronically, leading to 2 leptons plus
6 jets and one lepton plus 8 jets, respectively. The complexity of the final
states and the small statistics requires a neural network analysis
\cite{Strasbourg}.

the $Ht\bar t$ Yukawa coupling of the order of 5\% can be achieved for Higgs
masses in the low range. A 10\% measurement is possible up to Higgs masses of
the order of 200 GeV. \s 

For large masses, $M_H \gsim 350$ GeV, the $Ht \bar{t}$ coupling can be derived
by measuring the $H \ra t\bar{t}$ branching ratio with the Higgs boson produced
in the strahlung and $WW$ fusion processes \cite{Hagiwara,Hagiwara0}. A 
detailed 
simulation, performed for the TESLA TDR in the latter channel, shows that
once the $t\bar t$ and $\ee t\bar t$ backgrounds are removed by requiring four 
light jets and two $b$ quarks in the final state in addition to the missing 
energy, an accuracy of the order of 5\% (12\%) for a Higgs mass of 400 (500) 
GeV can be achieved on the top quark Yukawa coupling, again at $\sqrt{s}= 
800$ GeV and with ${\cal L} \sim 1$  ab$^{-1}$ data \cite{Httexp}. 

\subsubsection*{\underline{The trilinear Higgs coupling}}

The measurement of the trilinear Higgs self--coupling, which  is the
first non--trivial probe of the Higgs potential and, probably, the most decisive
test of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism, is possible in the double
Higgs--strahlung process. For Higgs masses in the range 120 GeV $\lsim M_H 
\lsim 140$ GeV, one has to rely on the $b\bar b$ decays and the cross section 
in the $\ee \to HHZ \to \bar{b}b \bar{b}b+\ell^+ \ell^-$ or $q\bar{q}$ 
channels is rather small, see Fig.~4.20, while the four and six fermion 
background are comparatively very large. \s

The excellent $b$--tagging efficiencies and the energy flow which can be
achieved at future linear colliders makes it possible to overcome the
formidable challenge of suppressing the backgrounds, while retaining a
significant portion of the signal.  Accuracies of about 20\% can be obtained
on the measurement of the $\ee \to HHZ$ cross section in the mass range below 
140 GeV; see the left--hand side of Fig.~4.38. Neural network analyses allow 
to improve the accuracy of the measurement from 17\% to 13\% at a Higgs mass 
$M_H=120$ GeV and to obtain a 6$\sigma$ significance for the signal
\cite{Clermont-Ferrand}; see also Ref.~\cite{HHH-baur}. \s

Since the sensitivity of the process $\ee \to HHZ$ to the trilinear Higgs 
coupling is diluted by the additional contributions originating from diagrams 
where the Higgs boson is emitted from the $Z$ boson lines, only an accuracy of 
$\Delta \lambda_{HHH} \sim 22\%$  can be obtained for $M_H=120$ GeV at an 
energy of  $\sqrt{s}\sim 500$ GeV with an integrated luminosity of
${\cal L} \sim 1$  ab$^{-1}$. The accuracy becomes worse for higher Higgs 
masses. In particular, for $M_H \gsim 140$ GeV, the $H\to WW^*$ decays must 
be used, leading to the even more complicated $4W$+$2f$ final state topologies.
No experimental analysis of this topology has been attempted yet.\s

Also in this case, one can proceed to higher energy and take advantage of the
$WW$ fusion process $\ee\to HH \nu \bar \nu$ \cite{Yamashita,Yamashita0} which
has a larger cross section, in particular with longitudinally polarized $e^\pm$
beams. The estimated sensitivity of the trilinear Higgs couplings to $\sqrt{s}$
is shown in the right--hand side of Fig.~4.38 for $M_H=120$ and 150 GeV with
polarized electron beams and no efficiency loss \cite{Yamashita}. It is
dominated by Higgs--strahlung at low energy and $WW$ fusion for $\sqrt{s} \gsim
700$ GeV. A recent simulation at $\sqrt{s}=1$ TeV which combines both the $\ee
\to HHZ$ and $\ee \to HH\nu \bar \nu$ processes with  $HH\to 4b$ final states,
assuming a 80\% $e^-_L$ polarization and a luminosity of 1 ab$^{-1}$, shows
that an accuracy of $\Delta \lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{HHH} \sim 12\%$ may be
achieved if the trilinear coupling is SM--like \cite{Yamashita}. The relative
phase of the coupling and its sign, may be also measured from the interference
terms \cite{LCWS,Yamashita}. \\

\subsubsection*{\underline{Expectations for a heavier Higgs boson}}

Finally, let us make a few remarks about a Higgs boson that is heavier than
$2M_Z$, which has been recently discussed in Ref.~\cite{ee-H-heavy}. In this
case, all decay channels other than $H \to WW,ZZ$ are not accessible
experimentally. The only exceptions are the $b\bar b$ decays for masses $M_H
\lsim 200$ GeV and the $t\bar t$ decays for $M_H \gsim 350$ GeV. However, the
Higgs boson mass and its total decay width, as well as the production cross
sections which provide the couplings to gauge bosons, can be obtained from the
lineshape. Typical accuracies on these parameters are shown in Table  4.8 at a
c.m. energy of 500 GeV with 500 fb$^{-1}$. The accuracies of the $WW$ and $ZZ$
branching are also shown for the same energy and luminosity
[other decay channels have not been discussed yet]. Thus, relatively
precise measurements can also be performed for heavier Higgs particles.

\subsubsection{Combined measurements and the determination of the 
couplings}

Once the Higgs production cross sections and the various decay branching ratios
have been measured, one can derive the Higgs boson couplings to
fermions and gauge bosons. This is a crucial test for the experimental 
verification that the Higgs mechanism is responsible for the generation of the
masses of the particles. Since some of the couplings can be determined in
different ways, while other determinations are partially correlated, a global
fit to the various observables is highly desirable to extract the Higgs 
couplings in a model independent way. Such a fit would optimize the collected
information and takes properly into account all the experimental correlations
between the various measurements. \s

A dedicated program called {\sc hfitter} \cite{Hfitter}, based on {\sc hdecay}
\cite{HDECAY} for the calculation of the Higgs decay branching ratios, has been
developed for this purpose. It uses as inputs the production cross sections
$\sigma(\ee \to HZ)$, $\sigma(\ee \to H\nu \bar{\nu})$ and $\sigma(\ee \to
t\bar{t}H)$, and the branching ratios into $WW, \gamma \gamma, b\bar{b},
c\bar{c}, \tau^+ \tau^-$ and $gg$. It uses the full covariance matrix for the
correlated measurements, and the non--correlated measurement of the Higgs
self--coupling from $\sigma( \ee \to HHZ)$ can be added.  The results for the
accuracies on the Higgs couplings to fermions, gauge bosons and the
self--coupling are displayed in Table 4.9 for $M_H=120$ GeV and 140 GeV at a
c.m. energy of 500 GeV with a luminosity of 500 fb$^{-1}$  [except again for
the measurement of $g_{Htt}$ which has been performed at  $\sqrt{s}=800$ GeV
with a luminosity of 1 ab$^{-1}$; the same luminosity is also used for the
measurement of $\lambda_{HHH}$].  For completeness, we also display the errors
on the Higgs boson mass, its total decay width and its CP--even component
[$\Delta {\rm CP}$ represents the relative deviation from the 0$^{++}$ case],
which have been measured at $\sqrt{s}=350$ GeV  with the same luminosity ${\cal
L} =500$ fb$^{-1}$. \s

(500) GeV in addition. On top of the table we display the accuracies on the
Higgs mass, the total width and its CP--component as obtained at $\sqrt{s}=350$
GeV with 500 fb$^{-1}$.}
\end{table}

As can be seen, an $\ee$ linear collider in the energy range $\sqrt{s}= 
350$--800 GeV and a high integrated luminosity, ${\cal L} \sim 500$ fb$^{-1}$,
is a very high precision machine in the context of Higgs physics.  This
precision would allow the determination of the complete profile of the SM Higgs
boson, in particular  if its mass is smaller than $\sim 140$ GeV. It would also
allow to distinguish the SM Higgs particle from a scalar particle occurring in
some of its extensions, with a very high level of confidence. \s

Thus, very precise measurements can be performed at the next linear collider
allowing the detailed exploration of the electroweak symmetry breaking
mechanism and the determination of the fundamental properties of the Higgs boson
in the SM.  We have seen in the previous section on hadron colliders that 
while the SM Higgs boson will undoubtedly be produced at the LHC, the detailed
study of its properties will be a difficult task in the rather hostile hadronic
environment. Due to the limited signal statistics for some channels, the large
backgrounds and various systematic uncertainties, the LHC can provide only some
ratios of Higgs couplings  [as well as the Higgs mass and the total decay width
for $M_H \gsim 200$ GeV, which can be measured rather well]. The measurement of
the various absolute couplings can be performed only at an $\ee$ collider. 
There is therefore a clear complementarity between the LHC and the linear 
collider Higgs physics programs. \s

From the previous discussions, one can single out two physics points for which
$\ee$ colliders have some weakness: the determination of the total width is
rather poor [without the $\gamma \gamma$ option] for low mass Higgs bosons and
the CP--quantum numbers cannot be determined in a very convincing way for $M_H
\gsim 140$ GeV when the $H \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ decay mode becomes too rare.
Unambiguous tests of the CP properties of the Higgs boson can be performed at 
photon colliders in the loop induced process $\gamma \gamma \ra H$ or at muon
colliders in the process $\mu^+ \mu^- \to H$, if suitable polarization of the
initial beams is available.  The measurement of $\Gamma_H$ can benefit from the
precise determination of the Higgs photonic width at $\gamma \gamma$ colliders.
However, it is at the muon collider that extremely good accuracies on
$\Gamma_H$ can be obtained by simply performing a threshold scan around the
Higgs resonance produced in $\mu^+ \mu^- \to H$.  These topics will be
addressed in detail in the next section. Before that, we first briefly 
summarize the benefits of raising and lowering the energy of the $\ee$ collider.

\subsubsection{Measurements at higher and lower energies}

\subsubsection*{\underline{Measurements at CLIC}}

Some of the previously discussed measurements can significantly benefit from an
increase of
statistics. This can be obtained not only by increasing the luminosity, but 
also by raising the energy. Indeed, at the c.m. energies relevant for CLIC, 
$\sqrt{s} \sim 3$ TeV, the cross section for the $WW$ fusion process becomes 
extremely large. If the luminosity is also scaled with $s$, a sample of more 
than one million Higgs particles can be collected for ${\cal L}=3$ ab$^{-1}$. 
Some of the previous measurements could thus be performed with more accuracy  
and new ones could be made possible. Examples of such measurements at CLIC are 
as follows \cite{CLIC}: \s

$i)$ With $\cal L =$ 3 ab$^{-1}$ at a c.m. energy of 3 TeV, 400 $H \to \mu^+
\mu^-$ events can be collected for $M_H=120$ GeV.  This sample would allow the
measurement of the Higgs couplings to muons to better than 5\%
[the precision drops to 10\% for $M_H=150$ GeV due to the smaller branching
ratio]. The dimuon signal can be isolated from the important $WW, WW\nu \bar
\nu, ZZ \nu\bar \nu$ backgrounds with a statistical significance which is
rather large; see the left--hand side of Fig.~4.39.  This would be the first
precise measurement of the Higgs couplings to second generation fermions since,
as seen previously, although the $Hc\bar{c}$ coupling can be determined with
the same accuracy, the associated theoretical uncertainties are rather large. \s

$ii)$ The $H\to b \bar{b}$ branching ratio becomes very small in the 
intermediate and high Higgs mass ranges, and at $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV, it cannot 
be determined to better than 10\% for $M_H \sim 200$ GeV. At $\sqrt{s}=3$ TeV,
the signal to background ratio is very favorable at these masses, as shown in 
the right--hand side of Fig.~4.39, and the rather large number 
of events to be collected at CLIC would allow a measurement of the $Hb\bar{b}$ 
coupling with an accuracy of 5\% for Higgs masses up to about $M_H=250$ GeV. 
\s

$\sqrt{s}$=3~TeV \cite{ee-H3-Battaglia}.}
\vspace*{-0.5cm}
\end{figure}


$iii)$ The trilinear Higgs coupling can be measured in the $WW$ fusion process,
$\ee \to \nu \bar{\nu}HH$, for which the cross section reaches the level of a
few fb at energies around 3 TeV. A relative accuracy of $\sim 10\%$ can be
obtained on this coupling for Higgs masses up to 250 GeV. Contrary to what 
occurs in the process $\ee \to
HHZ$, the interference between the diagram involving the self--Higgs coupling
and the others, is negative.  The sensitivity to $\lambda_{HHH}$ can be
enhanced by studying the angle $\theta^*$ of the $H^* \to HH$ system
in its rest frame: because of the scalar nature of the Higgs boson, the $\cos 
\theta^*$ distribution is flat for $H^* \rightarrow HH$ while it is peaked in 
the forward direction for the other diagrams \cite{gam-WWHH}; see the 
left--hand side of Fig.~4.40. From a fit of the distribution one can perform
a very nice determination of the $\lambda_{HHH}$
coupling as shown in the right--hand side of Fig.~4.40.  Note that the
quadrilinear Higgs couplings remains elusive, even at c.m.  energies of 5 TeV.

\vspace*{-0.3cm}
\end{figure}


The higher energy of the collider can also be very useful in the case where
the Higgs boson is very heavy. For $M_H \sim 700$ GeV and beyond, the cross
sections in the Higgs--strahlung and $WW$ fusion processes are small at
$\sqrt{s} \sim 1$ TeV [see Fig.~4.30] and do not allow to perform detailed
studies. At CLIC energies, $\sqrt{s}=3$ TeV, one has $\sigma (\ee \to H\nu \bar
\nu) \sim 150$ fb which allows for a reasonable sample of Higgs particles to
be studied. In addition, the cross section for the $ZZ$ fusion process is large
enough, $\sigma (\ee \to H\ee) \sim 20$ fb for $M_H \sim 700$ GeV, to allow for
model independent Higgs searches in much the same way as in the
Higgs--strahlung process at low energies, since the forward electron and
positron can be tagged, and the mass recoiling against them can be
reconstructed. The high energy available at CLIC will also be important to
investigate in detail a possible strongly interacting Higgs sector scenario, as
will be discussed in another part of this review.  

\subsubsection*{\underline{The GigaZ and MegaW options}}

The high luminosities available at the next generation of $\ee$ colliders
would allow to collect more than $10^{9}$ $Z$ bosons in one year by running 
at energies close to the resonance. The same luminosity would allow to collect
more than $10^6$ $W$ boson pairs near the $WW$ threshold. These samples are
two orders of magnitude larger than those obtained at LEP1 and LEP2 and can 
be used to significantly improve the high--precision tests of the SM which
have been performed in the last decade \cite{LC-GigaZ}. \s

At GigaZ, using the possibility of polarizing the electron/positron beams, one
can measure the longitudinal left--right asymmetry
$A_{LR}=2a_ev_e/(a_e^2+v_e^2) \sim 2(1-4\sin^2\theta_{\rm eff}^{\rm lep})$ with
a very high statistical accuracy in hadronic and leptonic $Z$ decays. Using the
Blondel scheme \cite{Blondel}, the asymmetry can be obtained from the cross
sections when the polarization of both the electron and positron beams
$P_{e^\pm}$ are used in the various combinations,  $\sigma = \sigma_{\rm unpol}
[1 - P_{e^+} P_{e^-} + A_{LR} ( P_{e^+} - P_{e^-} )]$, leading to a
systematical error of about $10^{-4}$. This corresponds to a measurement of the
electroweak mixing angle with a precision 
\beq
\Delta \sin^2\theta_{\rm eff}^{\rm lep} \simeq 1.3 \times 10^{-5}
\eeq
which is one order of magnitude more accurate than the presently measured 
value, $\sin^2\theta_{\rm eff}^{\rm lep} = 0.2324 \pm 0.00012$. The measurement
of the total and partial $Z$ decay widths and the various polarization and/or 
forward--backward asymmetries can be significantly improved. In particular, the
measurement of the ratio of leptonic to hadronic $Z$ decay widths with an 
expected accuracy of $\Delta R_\ell/R_\ell \sim 0.05\%$, would allow a clean 
measurement of the strong coupling constant to better than $\Delta \alpha_s
\simeq 0.001$. \s

On the other hand, one can perform a scan around the $WW$ threshold, where
the cross section for $W$ pair production rises quickly, $\sigma(\ee \to W^+W^-)
\sim \beta$, allowing an accurate measurement of the $W$ boson mass. With an
integrated luminosity of only ${\cal L} \simeq 100$ fb$^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}\sim 
2M_W$ and a 6 point scan, the mass can be measured with an accuracy
\beq
\Delta M_W \simeq 6~{\rm MeV}
\eeq
which is six times better than the present measurement, $M_W = 80.449 \pm 
0.034$ GeV, and almost three times the precision which can be reached at 
the LHC and at the LC.\s 

Since the top quark mass, which leads to the major part of the theoretical
uncertainties in the present high--precision observables, will be measured with
an accuracy of $\Delta m_t \simeq 200$ MeV at the LC and that $\alpha_s$ will be
known more precisely at this time, $\Delta \alpha_s \simeq 0.001$, the only
dangerous source of errors from SM inputs will be the hadronic uncertainty in
$\Delta \alpha$. One might hope that with the low energy $\ee$ experiments
which will be performed in the future, the error will reduce to $\Delta 
\alpha^{\rm had} \simeq 5 \times 10^{-5}$. Taking into account also the error 
 $\Delta M_Z \simeq 2$ MeV on the $Z$ boson mass, which at this level of 
precision induces an error on $\sin^2\theta_{\rm eff}^{\rm lep}$ which is of 
the same size as the experimental error, the future total theoretical 
uncertainties on the two observables from the various sources are estimated 
to be \cite{GigaZ-P}
\beq 
\Delta \sin^2\theta_{\rm eff}^{\rm lep} \simeq \pm 3 \times 10^{-5} \ , \
\Delta M_W \simeq \pm 3~{\rm MeV}
\eeq
The very small experimental and theoretical errors on these two parameters
will allow to test the SM on much more solid grounds than in the past and to 
isolate the effects of the Higgs boson in the electroweak radiative corrections
with an incredible accuracy. This is exemplified in the left--hand side of 
Fig.~4.41 where the expected accuracy in the determination of the Higgs  
mass at GigaZ/MegaW in the plane $M_H$--$m_t$, together with the allowed bands 
for $\sin^2\theta_{\rm eff}^{\rm lep}$ and $M_W$, are shown. The central 
values of the various input parameters and the Higgs mass, as well as the area 
labeled ``now", are for the measurements which were available in the year 2000. 
One can simply notice the vast improvement which can be made at the 
GigaZ/MegaW option, where one can indirectly measure the Higgs boson mass 
with a precision of $\Delta M_H/M_H \sim 7\%$ \cite{GigaZ-P}. One can also use 
the direct measurement of the Higgs boson mass at the LC (and LHC) with
$\Delta M_H \simeq 50$ MeV, to predict the value of $\sin^2\theta_{\rm eff}^{\rm
lep}$ and $M_W$ and to check the consistency of the SM, as shown in the
right--hand side of Fig.~4.41. Because of the high--precision which can be 
reached at GigaZ/MegaW, the improvement compared to the present situation and 
even after LHC/LC is again spectacular.

\subsection{Higgs production in  $\gamma \gamma$ collisions}

As discussed in \S4.1.2, future high--energy $\ee$ linear colliders can be made
to run in the $e \gamma$ or $\gamma \gamma$ modes by using Compton back
scattering of laser light off the high--energy electron beams
\cite{gamma-machine1,gamma-machine2}.  These colliders will have practically
the same energy, up to $\sim 80$\%, as the original $\ee$  collider and a
luminosity that is somewhat smaller.  One of the best motivations for turning
to the $\gamma\gamma$ mode of the linear collider is undoubtedly the study of
the properties of the Higgs boson, which can be produced as a resonance in the
$s$--channel \cite{gamma-Rev-old,BBC,gamma-Rev-TESLA,gamma-Rev-NLC}. In this 
context, two main
features which are difficult to study in the $\ee$ mode can be investigated at
such colliders: first, the  precise measurement of the $H\gamma\gamma$ coupling
\cite{gam-Hff,gam-Hff-Warsaw,gam-HWW,gam-HZZ,gam-HVV-Warsaw} and second, the 
determination of the CP--properties of the Higgs boson 
\cite{CPHff1,gam-HVV-Warsaw,gam-Gun,gam-Htt-Roh,gam-Htt-Asa1,gam-Htt-Asa2,gam-Htt-rev}. 
Several other studies can also be made, such as the measurement of the Higgs 
boson
self--coupling and its Yukawa coupling to top quarks, although these studies
can be already performed in $\ee$ collisions [and, in general, in a much
cleaner way]. 

\subsubsection{Higgs boson production as an s--channel resonance}

The production cross section for the process $\gamma \gamma \to X$ with
initial state polarized photons, can be written in the helicity basis as
\beq
{\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{\gamma \gamma}  = \sum_{i,j,k,l=\pm} \, \rho^1_{ik} \,  
\rho^2_{jl} M_{ij} M^*_{kl} \, {\rm d}\Gamma
\eeq
where $M_{ij}$ are the invariant scattering amplitudes with photon helicities
$i,j=\pm 1$ and ${\rm d}\Gamma$ the phase space element divided by the
incoming  flux. Comparing to the cross section written in the Stokes parameter
basis, the elements of the photon polarization density matrix are such that
$\rho^i_{ \pm \pm}= \frac{1}{2} (1 \pm \xi_{i2}), \rho^{i}_{+-} = \rho^{i*}_{-+}
= - \frac{1}{2} (\xi_{i3}-i \xi_{i1})$. 
The unpolarized cross section is 
\beq
{\rm d} \hat{\sigma}  &=& {\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{00} \, =  \, \frac{1}{4} {\rm d}
\Gamma \, \left( \left| M_{++}  \right|^2 + \left| M_{--} \right|^2 
+ \left| M_{+-}  \right|^2 + \left| M_{-+} \right|^2 \right) \non \\
&=& \frac{1}{2} ({\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{J_Z=0} + {\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{J_Z=\pm2})
\, = \, \frac{1}{2} ({\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{||} + {\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{\perp}) 
\eeq
where ${\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{J_Z=0} \, ({\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{J_Z=\pm 2})$ 
are the cross sections for photons with total helicity $0\, (\pm 2)$ and 
${\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{||}\, ({\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{\perp})$ is for
parallel (orthogonal) linear photon polarizations. \s

In the case of a spin--zero particle, the production occurs through the $J_Z=0$
channel. In terms of the Higgs total decay width $\Gamma_H$, the width into two
photons $\Gamma(H \to \gamma \gamma)$ and into a given final state,
$\Gamma( H \to X)$, the cross section for the subprocess $\gamma \gamma \to
H$ is given by
\beq
\hat{\sigma} (W)= 8\pi \frac{ \Gamma (H \to  \gamma  \gamma)\Gamma(H \to X)}
{(W^2-M_H^2)^2+ M_H^2 \Gamma_H^2 } \, (1+ \lambda_1 \lambda_2)
\eeq
where $W$ is the invariant mass of the $\gamma \gamma$ system.   Using the same
photon helicities $\lambda_1 \lambda_2=1$ projects out the $J_Z=0$ component 
and therefore maximizes the Higgs cross section. \s

For masses  below $M_H \sim 2M_Z$, the Higgs boson is very narrow with a total
decay width $\Gamma_H \lsim 1\,$GeV and, therefore, the detector resolution
should be taken into account. When the Higgs  width can be neglected,  a
rather simple way to obtain the effective signal cross section is to introduce
a Gaussian smearing of the  $\gamma\gamma$ invariant mass $W$ \cite{BBC}
\beq
N_{\rm eff}= {\cal L}_{\rm eff}\ \frac{{\rm d} \sigma^{\rm eff}}{{\rm d} W} 
(W) = \int^{y_m\sqrt{s_{e^+e^-}}}_{M_X} {\rm d} W' 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\delta}\exp \left(-\frac{(W'-W)^2}{2\delta^2}\right)
\frac{{\rm d} {\cal L}}{{\rm d} W'} \ \langle \hat{\sigma}(W') \rangle
\label{gamma-eff}
\eeq
and select events within bins of invariant masses $M_H \pm \Delta$, where
the Higgs mass is assumed to be precisely known already.  In the previous
expression, ${\cal L}_{\rm eff}$ and $y_m \sqrt{s_{\ee}}$ are the effective
luminosity and the maximum energy of the $\gamma \gamma$ collider and $\delta$
is one sigma of the detector resolution for $W$.  The cross section for the
signal process $\gamma\gamma \to H \to X$  can be written as [for $\Gamma_H \ll
M_H$, $\Gamma_H M_H [(W^2-M_H^2)^2+M_H^2\Gamma_H^2]^{-1} \simeq \frac{\pi}
{2M_H} \delta (W- M_H)]$
\beq
\hat{\sigma}_{\rm signal}(W) = 4\pi^2\frac{\Gamma(H \to\gamma\gamma)
{\rm BR}(H \to X)}{M^2_H} (1+\lambda_1\lambda_2)\delta(W-M_H)
\eeq
Inserting this expression in eq.~(\ref{gamma-eff}), and selecting the events 
in the bin $M_H \pm \Delta$, one has
\beq
{\cal L}_{\rm eff}\ \sigma^{\rm eff}_{\rm signal} (M_H) = R(\Delta/\delta) \
\left. \frac{\rm d \cal L}{\rm dW }^{J_Z=0}\right|_{W=M_H} \
4\pi^2\frac{\Gamma(H \to \gamma\gamma){\rm BR}(H \to X)}{M^2_H}
\label{gamma-signal}
\eeq
with $R(\Delta/\delta)$ being the Gaussian error function giving the fraction 
of signal events contained in the bin $M_H\pm\Delta$ [for instance, for $\Delta
=2\delta$ one has $R \simeq 0.95$]. \s

The effective background, $\gamma \gamma \to X$, for an effective invariant 
mass of the two--photon system $W= M_H$ can be approximated by
\beq
N^{\rm eff}_{\rm bckg}(W) \simeq 2 \Delta \frac{{\rm d} {\cal L}}{{\rm d}W}
\langle {\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{\rm bckg} (W) \rangle
\eeq
if one assumes a smooth enough distribution of two--photon invariant masses 
weighted with luminosity distributions. \s

To have a large effective cross section for the Higgs boson signal, the
$\gamma \gamma$ energy must be tuned at the peak, $0.8 \sqrt{s}_{\ee} \sim M_H$
for a perfect spectrum, while the luminosity with circularly polarized laser 
photon and electron beams are chosen so that  they have opposite handedness 
with $x=4.83$. The $J_Z=0$ events containing the signal are then enhanced, 
while the $J_Z= \pm2$ events are suppressed \cite{gamma-machine2,gam-Kuhn}. \s

The measurement of the $\Gamma(H \to\gamma\gamma) \times {\rm BR}(H \to X)$ 
rate and, thus, the $H\gamma \gamma$ coupling squared if the branching ratio 
is known, will follow from eq.~(\ref{gamma-signal}) if the effective luminosity
and the Higgs mass are specified, and from the signal and background rates. 
The statistical error in the decay width times branching ratio determination is
\beq
\Delta (\Gamma \times {\rm BR}) /(\Gamma \times {\rm BR}) =({\cal L}_{\rm eff}
)^{-1} S^{-1}\sqrt{S+B}
\eeq

\subsubsection*{\underline{Low mass Higgs boson}}

In the low mass range,  $M_H \lsim 130$ GeV, the Higgs boson will mainly decay
into $b\bar{b}$ final states, $H \to b\bar{b}$, and the main source of
background is the continuum production of $b$-- and $c$--quark pairs
\cite{gam-ff}, including gluon radiation which leads to fake two--jet  events
\cite{gam-ff-NLO1}. The total cross section for heavy quark production, $\gamma
\gamma \to q\bar{q}$, with a polar cut in the center of mass of the 
two--photon system $|\cos \theta| <c$ is given, at the tree--level, by
\beq
\hat \sigma_{J_Z=0} (W) &=& \frac{12\pi\alpha^2 Q^4_q}{W^2}\frac{8m_q^2}{W^2}
\left( 1- \frac{2m_q^2}{W^2} \right) \left[ \frac{1}{2}\log \frac{1+c\beta}
{1-c\beta}+\frac{c\beta}{1-c^2\beta^2} \right] \non \\
\hat\sigma_{J_Z=2}(W) &=& \frac{12\pi\alpha^2 Q^4_q}{W^2}
\left[ \frac{1}{2}(5-\beta^4) \log \frac{1+c\beta}{1-c\beta}
-c\beta\left( 2+\frac{(1-\beta^2)(3-\beta^2)}{1-c^2\beta^2}
\right) \right] 
\label{ggqq:bckg}
\eeq
with the quark velocity $\beta=\sqrt{1-4m^2_q/W^2}$ and electric charge $Q_q$.
One can choose $c=0.7$ which helps to eliminate many background events which
are peaked in the forward and backward directions, with only a moderate loss of
the signal events. In addition, as can be seen, the contribution of the $J_Z=0$
channel is proportional to $m_q^2/W^2$ and is therefore strongly suppressed
\cite{gam-ff}. Choosing the configuration where $\lambda_1 \lambda_2=1$ helps 
to suppress the two--jet background, while it maximizes the signal cross 
section; see e.g. Refs.~\cite{gamma-machine2,gam-Kuhn}.  \s

The background cross sections receive important QCD radiative corrections
\cite{gam-ff-NLO1,gam-ff-NLO2}, which are particularly large for the $J_Z=0$ 
component to which additional continuum $q\bar{q}g$ final states contribute 
[one can select slim two--jet final state configurations to suppress this gluon
radiation  contribution to the $J_Z=0$ amplitude], and also non--negligible
electroweak corrections \cite{gam-ff-ew}. The radiative corrections to the 
signal
cross section discussed in \S2.3.1, and the corrections to the interference
between the signal and background cross sections \cite{gam-ff-Maggie} have to
be taken into account. In addition, one has to consider low energy $\gamma
\gamma \to$ hadrons processes which contribute to the overlaying events  
\cite{Manuel+Rohini}. The overlaying events are peaked in the forward and
backward directions and can be suppressed  by the angular cut. $b$--tagging is
of course mandatory and one can take advantage of the fact that the Higgs boson
is produced almost at rest so that the total longitudinal momentum of the 
visible particles is smaller than the total visible energy.\s

A full simulation, which uses a realistic spectrum for the photon collider and
includes the overlaying $\gamma \gamma \to$ hadrons events, as well as a
realistic $b$--tagging, has been recently performed \cite{gam-Hff-Warsaw}. The
signal  and backgrounds  events have been generated with all the relevant
higher--order corrections and including the fragmentation into hadrons, and the
expected response of the detector has been taken into account. Cuts such as 
those
discussed above have been applied and the output is shown in Fig.~4.42 where
the energy of the original collider, $\sqrt{s_{ee}}=210$ GeV leading to a
yearly luminosity of ${\cal L}_{\gamma \gamma}=410$ fb$^{-1}$, has been
optimized for the production of a Higgs boson with a mass $M_H=120$ GeV.\s

The left--hand side of the figure displays the reconstructed invariant mass
distribution of the selected $b\bar b$ events, when it is corrected to take 
into account the effect of the undetected neutrinos. The Higgs boson signal
as well as the $b\bar b (g)$ and $c \bar c (g)$ backgrounds including the 
overlaying events are displayed for $M_H=120$ GeV at the luminosity of 410 
fb$^{-1}$. The most precise measurement of the $H\to \gamma \gamma$ width is
obtained in the mass window 110--150 GeV which is indicated. With
the assumed luminosity, about 7000 signal events are reconstructed with 
about 9000 background events surviving the cuts, leading to a signal over 
background ratio of order one. Therefore, a statistical accuracy of 1.8\% can 
be achieved on the measurement of $\Gamma (H \to \gamma \gamma) \times {\rm BR}
(H\to b \bar{b})$. The right--hand side of the figure shows the accuracy 
of the measurement of $\Gamma (H \to \gamma \gamma) \times {\rm BR}
(H\to b \bar{b})$ for various Higgs mass values, with and without the inclusion 
of the overlaying events (OE). Again, this is the result of a full simulation 
where the energy of the initial collider has been optimized to produce a Higgs 
boson with a mass $M_H=130,140,150$ and 160 GeV. A precision of 2--7\% can be 
obtained in the entire Higgs mass range  $M_H=120$--160 GeV. \s

\vspace*{-.2cm}
\end{figure}

From the measurement of the branching ratio of the Higgs decays into bottom
quarks which, as seen previously, can be made with an accuracy of 1.5\%
for $M_H=120$ GeV [see Table 4.6], the partial decay width $\Gamma (H \to
\gamma \gamma)$ can be extracted with a precision of 2.3\%. With a precise
measurement of the $H\to \gamma \gamma$ branching ratio in the $\ee$ mode
of the collider, one can determine the Higgs total width with an accuracy of 
the order of 10\%. 
 
\subsubsection*{\underline{Heavier Higgs bosons}}

For masses larger than $M_H \sim 140$ GeV, the Higgs boson decays 
predominantly into massive gauge bosons, $H \to WW$ and $H\to ZZ$,  
the branching ratios being $\sim 2/3$ and $1/3$, respectively, for the
charged and  neutral decays for $M_H$ above the $ZZ$ threshold. The total
Higgs decay width becomes significant, being of the order of $\Gamma_H \sim 
1.5\,(8)$ GeV for $M_H=200\, (300)$ GeV, and cannot be neglected anymore. 
However, the total production cross section of such heavy Higgs particles 
is of the same order as the one discussed previously, once the energy of 
the $\gamma \gamma$ collider is tuned to the Higgs boson mass. \s

The backgrounds for the production of such a Higgs boson at $\gamma \gamma$
colliders are vector boson production, $\gamma \gamma \to W^+ W^-$ and $\gamma
\gamma \to ZZ$. The former process occurs at the tree--level and has an
extremely large cross section, $\sigma(\gamma \gamma \to W^+W^-) \sim {\cal
O}(10^2~{\rm pb})$ in both the $J_Z=0$ and $J_Z=\pm 2$ channels
\cite{gam-WW,Othergam-WW}. This background cannot therefore be very efficiently
suppressed by  selecting only the $J_Z=0$ channel in which the Higgs boson is
produced. The only region where the signal and backgrounds have similar rates
is for $M_H \sim 170$ GeV, where the Higgs boson decays almost 100\% of the
time into $WW$ bosons, while the background cross sections are not yet too
large since they increase with higher photon c.m. energy \cite{gam-HWW}. \s

In the case of $ZZ$ boson final states, the background is generated only at the
one--loop level \cite{gam-HZZ} since the $Z$ boson is neutrally charged and 
does not couple directly to photons. It is therefore much less dangerous than 
the $WW$
background: for c.m.  energies of the order of $\sqrt{s}_{\gamma \gamma} \sim
200-300$ GeV, the cross section is at the level $\sigma(\gamma \gamma \to ZZ)
\sim {\cal O}(10^2~{\rm fb})$ in the $J_Z=0$ channel. Therefore, for $M_H \gsim
180$ GeV where the $ZZ$ Higgs branching ratio becomes significant, the cross
section is dominated by the Higgs boson contribution. \s


For photons colliding with a total angular momentum $J_Z=0$, the interference
between the signal  $\gamma \gamma \to H \to VV$ and the background $\gamma
\gamma \to VV$ must be taken into account. For $WW$ final states, the
interference is very large: for $M_H \gsim 200$ GeV, this term is negative and
is larger than the resonant contribution from the Higgs boson, leading to a
decrease of the total $WW$ cross section. For $ZZ$ production, the interference
term is rather small, although it has visible effects, resulting for instance
in an asymmetric Higgs resonance.  Thus,  in addition to the extraction of the
$H\gamma \gamma$ couplings as in the $H \to b\bar{b}$ case discussed before,
these processes could in principle allow for the determination of the phase of 
the $H \gamma \gamma$ amplitude via a measurement of the interference term 
which is sensitive to it.   \s


A detailed simulation has been also performed in these two channels 
\cite{gam-HVV-Warsaw} and the analysis follows the same lines as what has 
been previously discussed in the case of $\gamma \gamma \to H \to b\bar b$. 
The cuts have been optimized to select the final states $H \to WW \to q\bar q 
q \bar q$ and $H \to ZZ \to q\bar q \ell \ell$. The center of mass energy of 
the original electron collider has been tuned to optimize Higgs production:
for $\sqrt{s_{ee}}=305\, (500)$ GeV, which is the optimal choice for $M_H=200 
\, (350)$ GeV, a luminosity of about 600 (1000) fb$^{-1}$ can be collected
in a photon collider such as the one discussed for TESLA. Once the 
distributions of the reconstructed invariant masses for $\gamma \gamma \to
WW$ and $ZZ$ are obtained experimentally, one can fit the simulated mass 
distributions with the width $\Gamma_{\gamma \gamma}$ and the phase 
$\phi_{\gamma \gamma}$ as being the only free parameters. \s

The output is shown in Fig.~4.43 where the statistical accuracies expected for 
the $\Gamma_{\gamma \gamma}$ width and the $\phi_{\gamma \gamma}$ phase are 
displayed for four examples of Higgs masses $M_H=200, 250, 300$ and 350 GeV. 
The solid thick light (yellow) line shows for comparison the prediction in a 
specific two--Higgs doublet model (2HDM). As can be seen for low Higgs masses, 
$M_H \sim 200$ GeV, the width can be measured with a precision $\Delta \Gamma_{
\gamma \gamma} \simeq 3\%$ which is similar to the accuracy obtained in the case
of $H\to b \bar b$. For this Higgs mass value, the phase can be measured 
with an accuracy of $\Delta \phi_{\gamma \gamma} \sim 35$ mrad. For higher
Higgs masses, the uncertainties increase and for $M_H=350$ GeV, they are
a factor of three larger. Note that the phase is mainly constrained by the $WW$ 
process as expected, while the width is more accurately measured in the channel 
$ZZ \to q\bar q \ell \ell$ as the background is smaller. Thus, it is
only the combination of the two processes which allow to determine both 
parameters.

W^-$ and $ZZ$ mass spectra. The yellow (thick light) band shows the prediction 
in a 2HDM \cite{gam-HVV-Warsaw}. }
  \vspace{-0.2cm}
\end{figure}

For even heavier Higgs bosons, $M_H \gsim 350$ GeV, the $H \to t\bar{t}$ decays
can be in principle exploited. However, the branching fraction is not very
large, BR($H \to t\bar{t}) \sim 15$\% for $M_H \simeq 400$ GeV, and becomes even
smaller for higher masses. The main background
process $\gamma \gamma \to t\bar{t}$ has a much larger cross section  [which is
still given by eq.~(\ref{ggqq:bckg})] compared to $b$--quark production, first
because of the larger charge $Q_t=+2/3$  with the cross section being
proportional to $Q_q^4$, and second, because the $J_{Z}=0$  contribution is not
suppressed since the top quark mass is of the same order as the effective
$\gamma \gamma$ energy. Furthermore, the total width of the Higgs boson 
becomes too large, $\Gamma_H \sim 30$ GeV  for the previous mass value, and the
particle is not a narrow resonance anymore; because of this large $\Gamma_H$ 
value, one has to integrate the continuum background over a rather large bin. \s

For all these  reasons, the process $\gamma \gamma \to H \to t\bar{t}$ is 
expected to be a rather difficult channel to exploit. However, it can provide 
some valuable information on the CP properties of the produced Higgs particle
\cite{gam-Htt-Roh,gam-Htt-Asa1,gam-Htt-Asa2,gam-Htt-rev}, a subject to which we turn our 
attention now.

\subsubsection{Measuring the CP--properties of the Higgs boson}

\subsubsection*{\underline{Measurements using photon polarization}} 

The general amplitude for the production of a spin--zero Higgs particle in
two--photon collisions, $\gamma \gamma \to H $,  cand be written in terms
of the CP--even and CP--odd components of the $H \gamma \gamma$ coupling which
are proportional to, respectively, $(\epsilon_1 \cdot \epsilon_2)$ and
$(\epsilon_1 \times \epsilon_2)$, as
\beq
M_{\lambda_1 \lambda_2} =  (\epsilon_1 \cdot \epsilon_2) {\cal C}_+ 
\, + \, (\epsilon_1 \times \epsilon_2) {\cal C}_-
\eeq
where ${\cal C}_+\, ({\cal C}_-)$ are the CP--even (odd) contributions to the
amplitude. Four independent functions describe the process out of
the 16 helicity amplitudes present in the general case
\beq
{\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{00} + {\rm d}\hat{\sigma}_{22} &=& \frac{1}{2} {\rm d}
\Gamma \, \left( \left| M_{++} \right|^2 + \left| M_{--} \right|^2 \right) 
= |{\cal C}_+|^2 + |{\cal C} _-|^2 \non \\
%
{\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{20} + {\rm d}\hat{\sigma}_{02} &=& \frac{1}{2} {\rm d}
\Gamma \, \left( \left| M_{++} \right|^2 - \left| M_{--} \right|^2 \right) 
= -2 {\rm Im} \left( {\cal C}_+ {\cal C}^*_- \right) \non \\
%
{\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{31} + {\rm d}\hat{\sigma}_{13} &=&  {\rm d}
\Gamma \, {\rm Im} \left( M_{++} M_{--}^* \right) 
= -2 {\rm Re} \left( {\cal C}_+ {\cal C}_-^* \right) \non \\
{\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{33} + {\rm d}\hat{\sigma}_{11} &=&  {\rm d}
\Gamma \, \left( M_{++} M^*_{--} \right) 
= |{\cal C}_+|^2 - |{\cal C}_-|^2 
\eeq
One can then define the asymmetries \cite{gam-Gun}
\beq
{\cal A}_1 &= & \frac{ \left| M_{++} \right|^2 - \left| M_{--} \right|^2 } 
{\left| M_{++} 
\right|^2 + \left| M_{--} \right|^2} = - \frac{2{\rm Im} ({\cal C}_+ {\cal 
C}_-^*)}{ |{\cal C}_+|^2 + |{\cal C}_-|^2}  \non \\
{\cal A}_2 &=& \frac{ 2 {\rm Im} (M_{++} M^*_{--})} {\left|M_{++} 
\right|^2 + \left| M_{--} \right|^2} = - \frac{2{\rm Re} ({\cal C}_+ {\cal 
C}_-^*)}{ |{\cal C}_+|^2 + |{\cal C}_-|^2}  \non \\
{\cal A}_3 &=& \frac{ 2{\rm Re} (M_{++} M^*_{--})} {\left|M_{++} 
\right|^2 + \left| M_{--} \right|^2} =  \frac{|{\cal C}_+|^2 - |{\cal 
C}_-^*|^2}{ |{\cal C}_+|^2 + |{\cal C}_-|^2}  
\eeq
and write the event rate as ${\rm d}N = {\rm d} {\cal L}^{J_Z=0} {\rm d} 
\hat{\sigma}$ with
\beq
{\rm  d} {\cal L}^{J_Z=0} = {\rm d} {\cal L} \bigg[ 1+\langle
\xi_{12} \xi_{22} \rangle + \langle \xi_{12}+ \xi_{22} \rangle {\cal A}_1
+  \langle \xi_{13} \xi_{21} + \xi_{11} \xi_{23} \rangle {\cal A}_2 
+  \langle \xi_{13} \xi_{23} - \xi_{11} \xi_{21} \rangle {\cal A}_3 \bigg]
\hspace*{0.6cm} 
\eeq
with the unpolarized cross section given by
\beq
{\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{0}= \frac{1}{4} {\rm d} \Gamma \, \left( \left| M_{++}
\right|^2 + \left| M_{--} \right|^2 \right) 
\eeq
If ${\cal A}_1$ and ${\cal A}_2$ are both non--zero, then, CP is violated since 
the Higgs boson is a mixture of CP--even and CP--odd states. One can thus, by 
analyzing the spins of the final photons, probe CP--violation. If the Higgs 
boson is a definite CP--eigenstate, that is, a pure scalar or pseudoscalar
particle, one has ${\cal A}_1={\cal A}_2=0$ and ${\cal A}_3= \eta_{\rm C}$ with 
$\eta_{\rm CP}=1 \, (-1)$ for a CP--even (CP--odd) Higgs particle. The 
luminosity written above simplifies then to
\beq
{\rm  d} {\cal L}^{J_Z=0} &=& {\rm d} {\cal L} \, \bigg[ 1+\langle
\xi_{12} \xi_{22} \rangle + \eta_{\rm CP} \langle \xi_{13} \xi_{23} - \xi_{11}
\xi_{21} \rangle \bigg]
\eeq
In fact, if CP is conserved, one has $M_{++} = \eta_{\rm CP} M_{--}$ leading to
the relation between cross sections with parallel and orthogonal linear
polarizations for the photons, ${\rm d} \hat{\sigma}_{||}-{\rm d} \hat{\sigma}
_\perp=\eta_{\rm CP} \cdot ({\rm d}\hat \sigma_{||}+{\rm d}\hat \sigma_\perp)$.
This means that  only photons with parallel (orthogonal) linear polarizations
couple to scalars  (pseudoscalars).  Note that only if the lasers are
linearly polarized that it is possible to distinguish between the two CP
quantum numbers  since the relevant average for the Stokes parameters, 
$\langle\xi_{13} \xi_{23}-\xi_{11} \xi_{21} \rangle$, is negligible for 
circularly polarized lasers. \s

In practice, the asymmetry ${\cal A}_3$ is determined by making two runs and  
measuring the difference of the event rates for lasers with parallel
polarization, $\Delta \gamma =0$, and lasers with perpendicular polarization,
$\Delta \gamma= \frac{\pi}{2}$ \cite{gam-Gun}
\beq
\langle {\cal A}_3 \rangle = \frac{ \sigma^{\rm eff} (\Delta \gamma=0) - 
\sigma^{\rm eff} (\Delta \gamma = \frac{\pi}{2})} {\sigma^{\rm eff} (\Delta 
\gamma=0) + \sigma^{\rm eff} (\Delta \gamma = \frac{\pi}{2})}
\eeq
where the contamination from the background is taken into account
$\sigma^{\rm eff}= \sigma^{\rm eff}_{\rm signal}+ \sigma^{\rm eff}_{\rm bckg}$.
In terms of the electron and laser beam polarization, the asymmetry is given by
\beq
\langle {\cal A}_3 \rangle \simeq \frac{ 
\eta_{\rm CP} \, \sigma_{\rm signal}  \, P_{1t} P_{2t} \langle \ell_1 \ell_2 
\rangle} {\frac{1}{2} (1+ 4\lambda_{e^-} \lambda_{e^+} \langle c_1 c_2 \rangle)
(2 \hat{\sigma}^{\rm signal}+ \hat{\sigma}_0^{\rm bckg}) +
\frac{1}{2} (1- 4\lambda_{e^-} \lambda_{e^+} \langle c_1 c_2 \rangle )
\hat{\sigma}_2^{\rm bckg} }
\eeq
where the effects for $\rho \neq 0$ have been ignored for simplicity [there is
also a generally small contribution to the background in the numerator from 
the component  $\hat{\sigma}^{\rm bckg}_{||} - \hat{\sigma}^{\rm bckg}_{\perp} 
\propto m_q^4/W^4$]. As can be  seen, a very important role is played by the
linear laser polarization  $P_{it}$, the average of the induced linear
polarizations of the photons  [the asymmetry is directly proportional to the
product] and by the  longitudinal polarizations of the electron beams and the
induced circular polarization of the photons. \s

The statistical significance of the signal is given by 
\beq
N_{\rm SD} ({\cal A}_3) = \frac{ |\sigma^{\rm eff} (\Delta \gamma=0) - 
\sigma^{\rm eff} (\Delta \gamma  = \frac{\pi}{2}) |} { \sqrt{\sigma^{\rm eff} 
(\Delta \gamma=0) + \sigma^{\rm eff} (\Delta \gamma = \frac{\pi}{2}) }}
\times \sqrt{ {\cal L}^{\rm eff}}  
\eeq
With the machine parameters, polarization and luminosity discussed above, a
measurement at the level of 10\% can be made, allowing the
distinction between the two CP possibilities for the Higgs particle; see 
Ref.~\cite{gam-Gun} for an analysis where a realistic luminosity spectra and 
photon polarizations are taken into account. 

\subsubsection*{\underline{Measurements using angular distributions}} 

Another way to test the CP nature of the produced Higgs particle is to study 
the angular distributions in its decays. For a relatively heavy Higgs boson, 
$M_H \gsim 2M_Z$, this can be done in the final state $H \to WW,ZZ\to 4f$ in 
which, as discussed in \S2.2.4, the angular correlations between the final 
state fermions are very different in the case of scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs
particles. For instance, the azimuthal dependence on the angle $\Delta \phi$ 
between the decay planes of the two vector bosons is characteristically 
different in the $0^{++}$ and $0^{+-}$ cases \cite{Bargeretal,CPHVVchoi}. 
Another different observable is the correlation 
\beq
\zeta_{VV} =  \frac{\sin^2\theta_1\; \sin^2\theta_3} {(1+\cos^2\theta_1) \;
(1+\cos^2\theta_3)} 
\eeq 
where $\theta_1$ and $\theta_3$ are the polar angles of the two fermions from
the $V \to f\bar f$ decays defined in Fig.~2.11 and which corresponds to
the ratio of the angular distributions expected for the decay of a scalar and a
pseudoscalar particle in the limit $M_H \gg M_V$. \s 

A detailed simulation in the decay channels $H \to ZZ \to \ell \ell jj$ and $H
\to WW \to 4j$ has been performed  \cite{gam-HVV-Warsaw} along the same lines 
as for
the measurement of the amplitudes of the $HVV$ couplings and their phases 
discussed earlier. The output of this analysis is shown in Fig.~4.44 for the 
example of a Higgs boson with a mass $M_H=200$ GeV, produced in the $\gamma 
\gamma$ mode of an $\ee$ collider with initial energy of $\sqrt{s_{\ee}}=
305$ GeV and decaying into $ZZ \to \ell \ell jj$ final states.  The figure 
shows the number of expected events for a scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs boson
and for the non--resonant SM background, for a variation of the reconstructed 
azimuthal angle $\Delta \phi_{ZZ}$ (left) and the correlation $\zeta_{ZZ}$ 
(right). The points with error bars indicate the statistical precision of the 
measurements after a one year running of the photon collider with a luminosity 
of 600 fb$^{-1}$. \s

If the $HVV$ coupling, including CP--violation, is parameterized as  $g_{HVV}= 
\lambda \cos \Phi$ with $\lambda=1$ and $\Phi=0$ in the SM, from a combined fit
of the $H \to WW/ZZ \to 4f$ events which includes a free variation of the two 
photon width and phase one can measure the absolute magnitude of the
coupling with a precision $\Delta \lambda/\lambda =2\%$ and the CP--violating
phase with a precision $\Delta \Phi= 50$ mrad, in the entire Higgs mass
range $M_H=200$--350 GeV \cite{gam-HVV-Warsaw}. \s 

Similar tests can be performed in the decay $H\to t\bar t$ for a heavier Higgs 
particle, $M_H >350$ GeV. In particular, the interference 
pattern of the resonant and the continuum amplitudes for the $\gamma\gamma 
\ra t \bar t$ process allows to check the parity of the Higgs boson and
the presence of CP--violation, by using circularly polarized colliding photons 
\cite{gam-Htt-Asa1}. Indeed, from the $t \bar t$ decay angular distribution 
one can built four convoluted observables $\Sigma_{1..4}$ 
\beq
\Sigma_i (\sqrt{s}_{\gamma\gamma})= \int {\rm d}\sqrt{s}_{\gamma\gamma} 
\sum_{\lambda_1,~\lambda_2} \left( \frac{1}{{\cal L} }\frac{ {\rm d}{\cal L}^{
\lambda_1\lambda_2}} {{\rm d} \sqrt{s}_{\gamma\gamma}} \right) \left( 
\frac{3\beta} {32\pi s_{\gamma\gamma}}
\int S^i_{\lambda_1 \lambda_2} (\theta, \sqrt{s}_{\gamma\gamma}){\rm d}
\cos\theta \right)
\end{eqnarray}
with $\theta$ being the polar angle of the $t$ momentum in the $\gamma\gamma$ 
c.m. frame and the first bracket corresponding to the normalized luminosity 
distribution for each of the photon $\lambda_1 \lambda_2$ helicity combinations.
The functions $S_{\lambda_1 \lambda_2}^i$ contain the information on the 
$\gamma\gamma \ra t\bar t$ helicity amplitudes
\beq
S^1_{\lambda_1 \lambda_2} = \left| M_{\lambda_1\lambda_2}^{RR} \right|^2\, , \
S^2_{\lambda_1 \lambda_2} = \left| M_{\lambda_1\lambda_2}^{LL} \right|^2\, , \
S^{3(4)}_{\lambda_1 \lambda_2} = 2{\rm Re} ({\rm Im}) \left[ 
M_{\lambda_1\lambda_2}^{RR} M _{\lambda_1\lambda_2}^{LL*} \right]
\eeq 
Writing the $\gamma \gamma \to t\bar t$ amplitudes as sums of the resonant 
and non--resonant contributions
\begin{eqnarray}
M_{\lambda \lambda}^{\sigma \sigma}= \left[ M_t \right]_{\lambda \lambda}^{
\sigma \sigma} + \left( \frac{\sqrt{s}_{\gamma\gamma}}{M_H} \right)^3
r_H \cdot i \left[ 1+{\rm exp} \left( 2i \tan^{-1} \frac{s_{\gamma\gamma}^2
-M_H^2}{M_H \Gamma_H} \right) \right]
\end{eqnarray}
the phase of the resonance amplitude is shifted by $r_H$ which is 
essentially the phase of the $\gamma\gamma H$ coupling when neglecting the 
phase in the $t \overline{t} H$ vertex. In the left--hand side of Fig.~4.45,
the four observables $\Sigma_{1..4 }$ for the production of scalar $H$ and 
pseudoscalar $A$ bosons with $M_{H,A}=400$ GeV, are shown for two values of the 
$\gamma\gamma H/A$ phase, arg$(r_{H,A})=0$ and ${\pi \over 4}$, and one can see
that the difference is significant enough to be measured experimentally. \s

\end{figure}

Another possibility to probe the Higgs CP--quantum numbers in $\gam \to t\bar 
t$ production is to look at the net polarization of the $t/\bar t$ quarks
either with circularly polarized \cite{gam-Htt-Asa2} or linearly polarized 
photons \cite{gam-Htt-Roh}. In the latter case, the top polarization has been 
analyzed through the decay lepton energy and angular distributions in the decay
$t\to b \ell \nu$. The full differential distribution of the decay lepton
has been written and, in terms of the initial state $\ee$ polarizations
$\lambda_{\ee}=\pm1$ and final charge   of the decay lepton $e_{\ell^\pm}=
\pm 1$, one can obtain four cross sections $\sigma (\pm, \pm)$ from which
one can construct six asymmetries that are sensitive to the Higgs coupling
\cite{gam-Htt-Roh}
\beq
{\cal A}_{1/4}=  \frac{\sigma(+,\pm)-\sigma(-,-)}{\sigma(+,\pm)+\sigma(-,-)}
\, , \ 
{\cal A}_{2/3}=  \frac{\sigma(+,\mp)-\sigma(-,+)}{\sigma(+,\mp)+\sigma(-,+)}
\, , \ 
{\cal A}_{5/6}=\frac{\sigma(\pm,+)-\sigma(\pm,-)}{\sigma(\pm,+)+\sigma(\pm,-)}
\label{asymm}
\eeq
${\cal A}_{5/6}$ are charge asymmetries for a given polarization and 
vanish for zero--angle, which is not the case for the purely CP--violating
${\cal A}_{1/2}$ asymmetries;  ${\cal A}_{3/4}$ are the polarization
asymmetries for a given lepton charge. Note that the charge asymmetries do not
vanish in the case of the SM where only the non--resonant amplitude is taken
into account. The sensitivity of the six asymmetries to the $\gamma\gamma H/A$
coupling and to its possible CP--violating component is exhibited in the 
right--hand side of Fig.~4.45 for a specific point with $M_{H,A}=500$ GeV 
and a $\gamma \gamma H/A$ vertex which has both real and imaginary parts, 
as a function of the electron beam energy. As can be seen, the asymmetries can 
be large and in most cases different from  the asymmetries of the continuum
$\gamma \gamma \to t \bar t$ production. \s 

Finally, for  $M_H \lsim 140$ GeV, one can also study the CP--nature of the 
Higgs boson by looking at the polarization of the $\tau$ leptons produced in 
$\gamma \gamma \to H \to \tau^+ \tau^-$. One can again construct polarization 
asymmetries which probe  both the $H\gamma \gamma$ and $H\tau \tau$ couplings 
\cite{gam-Hll-Singh}

\subsubsection{Other Higgs production mechanisms}

Other processes than Higgs boson production as s--channel resonances have been
discussed in the context of $\gam$ colliders: Higgs pair production via
loop diagrams \cite{gam-HH,gam-HH1}, production  in association with vector
bosons \cite{gam-WWH, gam-WWHH,gam-HZ} and associated Higgs production
with top quarks \cite{gam-ttH}. At $e\gamma$ colliders, the Higgs boson can
also be produced in the reaction $e\gamma \to \nu_eW^+ H$
\cite{egam-H,egam-Hall}.  In this section, we briefly summarize the main
features of these processes, concentrating only on the magnitude of the cross
sections of the subprocesses [i.e. without folding with the photon luminosity
spectra].  

\subsubsection*{\underline{Higgs pair production: $\gamma \gamma \to HH$}}

The pair production of Higgs bosons in $\gamma \gamma$ collisions is induced by
loops of top quarks and $W$ bosons where two sets of diagrams are involved:
$(i)$ $s$--channel vertex diagrams where the intermediate Higgs particle splits
into two and which involves the trilinear Higgs coupling $\lambda_{HHH}$;
the contributions of these diagrams are essentially the same as those discussed
for $\gamma \gamma \to H$, except that here the Higgs particle is virtual, and 
($ii)$ box diagrams involving top quarks and $W$ bosons, as well as
vertex and self--energy diagrams which do not involve the trilinear Higgs
coupling but the quartic Higgs--gauge boson interaction. \s

The cross section has been calculated in Ref.~\cite{gam-HH} in the SM case; see
also Ref.~\cite{gam-HH1}. At small energies, $\sqrt{s}_{\gamma \gamma} \sim
500$ GeV, it is dominated by the top quark contribution. For photons having the
same helicities,  it is at the level of $\sim 0.5$ fb for $M_H \sim 100$ GeV,
decreases very slowly with $M_H$ and falls--off rapidly when approaching the
$\sqrt{s}_{\gamma \gamma} =2M_H$ threshold.  At higher energies,
$\sqrt{s}_{\gamma \gamma} \gsim 1$ TeV, the cross section is dominated by the
$W$ boson loop contribution which, contrary to the case of single Higgs boson,
interferes constructively with the top quark contribution for large enough
$M_H$.  While the cross section  is smaller than at 500 GeV for low $M_H$, it
increases with $M_H$ almost up to the kinematical boundary, where it reaches
values of the order $1\, (10)$ fb at $\sqrt{s}_{\gamma \gamma} \sim 1\, (2)$
TeV.  This is mainly due to the large triple and quartic Higgs couplings to the
Goldstone or $W_L$ bosons which grow as $M_H^2$.\s 

 For opposite photon helicities, the cross section has the same magnitude as 
in the same--helicity case for $M_H\sim 100$ GeV, but because in this case it  
is dominated by the contributions of transverse $W$ bosons it  falls off more
rapidly with increasing $M_H$ values even for high center of mass energies. At 
$\sqrt{s}=2$ TeV, there is bump for a very heavy Higgs boson. \s

The sensitivity of the production cross section to the trilinear Higgs coupling
$\lambda_{HHH}$ depends on the relative weight of the diagram with the exchange
of the Higgs boson in the $s$--channel and the other diagrams
\cite{gam-HH1}. For very heavy
Higgs bosons, $M_H \sim 500-800$ GeV, the cross section is very sensitive to the
coupling $\lambda_{HHH}$, in particular near the $\sqrt{s}_{\gamma \gamma} =2
M_H$ threshold where it is maximal: for $M_H \sim 700$ GeV, removing the
trilinear coupling leads to an increase of the cross section [which is
unfortunately rather small, being less than 1 fb] by about 60\%.  For smaller
$M_H$ values, the sensitivity is much weaker since the cross section at high
energies [where it is sizable] is dominated by the box contributions which do
not involve $\lambda_{HHH}$, while at low energies the rates are too small. 
Note finally, that a change of the trilinear Higgs coupling does not affect the
angular distribution of the Higgs pair production process. \s

Thus, at very high energies and for rather heavy Higgs bosons, on can  possibly
probe the trilinear Higgs coupling in the process $\gamma \gamma \to HH$. This
is complementary to the $\ee$ case where the coupling can be best probed for
low Higgs boson masses. However, to assess to which extent the coupling can be
measured, more detailed analyses are needed.  

\subsubsection*{\underline{Higgs production in association with top quarks: 
$\gamma \gamma \to t\bar{t} H$}}

The process $\gamma \gamma \to t\bar{t}H$ offers an additional opportunity to
probe the Yukawa coupling of the Higgs boson to top quarks 
\cite{gam-ttH,gam-ttH0}. Contrary to the
similar process in the $\ee$ case, where the Higgs boson can be radiated not 
only from the top quark lines but also from the $Z$ line in the Higgs strahlung
like process $\ee \to HZ^* \to Ht\bar{t}$ [although the  contribution of the
latter is very tiny as discussed earlier], in associated $Ht\bar{t}$ 
production in photon--photon collisions, the Higgs boson is only radiated 
from the top quark lines and the cross section is directly proportional to
the $Ht\bar{t}$ Yukawa coupling. \s

As in the case of $\ee$ collisions, the cross section for $t\bar{t}H$
production is rather small at $\sqrt{s}_{\gamma  \gamma} \sim 500$  GeV,
because of the limited phase space. It increases with energy and for $M_H \sim
100$ GeV it reaches the level of $\sigma (\gamma \gamma \to t\bar{t}H) = {\cal
O}(1~{\rm fb})$ at $\sqrt{s}_{\gamma \gamma} \sim 1$ TeV, where it begins to
flatten [this is opposite to the $\ee$ case, where $\sigma \propto 1/s$]. The 
cross section drops rapidly with increasing $M_H$ and
at a c.m. energy of 1 TeV it is one order of magnitude smaller for $M_H \sim
200$ GeV than for $M_H \sim 100$ GeV. \s

The $\gamma \gamma \to t\bar{t}H$ process can be used as a means to
determine the CP properties of the Higgs boson and to distinguish between
scalar and pseudoscalar particles and to probe CP--violation.  
In addition, associated Higgs production with lighter fermions, such as
$\tau$--leptons and $b$--quarks, which have larger cross sections in extensions
of the SM where the Higgs couplings to down--type fermions are enhanced, has
been discussed \cite{bb-H-gamma}.  

\subsubsection*{\underline{Higgs production in association with gauge 
bosons}}

As mentioned previously, the $\gam \to W^+ W^-$ production cross section is
enormous, being at the level of ${\cal O}(100~{\rm pb})$ for c.m. energies
around $\sqrt{s}_{\gamma \gamma} \sim 300-500$ GeV \cite{gam-WW}, and one could
attach one or even two additional Higgs bosons to the $W$ lines, while still
having sizable rates \cite{gam-WWH}. For a Higgs boson with a mass $M_H \sim
100$ GeV, the cross section for $\gamma \gamma \to W^+W^-H$ is about 20 fb for
$\sqrt{s}_{\gamma \gamma}= 500$ GeV and,  therefore, it is at level of the
cross section for the Higgs--strahlung process in $\ee$ collisions with the
same c.m.~energy. The cross section quickly rises with energy, to reach the
level of 400 fb for $\sqrt{s}_{\gamma \gamma}=2$ TeV, i.e. almost two orders of
magnitude larger than the Higgs--strahlung cross section which drops like
$1/s$, and of the same order as the dominant production mechanism, $\ee \to
H\nu \bar{\nu}$.  Compared to the processes for  associated Higgs production
with gauge bosons in $\ee$ collisions discussed previously, $\sigma( \gamma
\gamma \to W^+W^-H)$ is a factor of three larger than any of the $\ee \to HVV$
processes.  Note however, that this process does not provide any additional
information that could not be obtained in the $\ee$ option of the machine. \s

A channel that is, in principle, more interesting is when two Higgs particles
are produced in association with the $W$ boson pair. Indeed, similarly to the
$WW$ fusion mechanism $WW \to HH$, this process is sensitive to the trilinear
Higgs boson coupling since the Higgs particle produced in $\gamma \gamma \to
WWH$ can split into two Higgs bosons.  Unfortunately, the rates are too small
to be useful even with very high luminosities \cite{gam-WWHH}: for $\gam$
energies of the order of 1 TeV, $\sigma (\gamma \gamma \to W^+W^- HH) \sim
0.02$ fb for $M_H \sim 100$ GeV, and barely reaches 0.2 fb at $\sqrt{s}_{\gamma
\gamma}\sim 2$ TeV. Finally, note that the Higgs bosons can be also produced in
association with a $Z$ boson in the loop induced process $\gamma
\gamma \to HZ$ \cite{gam-HZ} where, in particular,  virtual top quarks and $W$ 
bosons contribute.  The cross section are, however, rather small: for
$\sqrt{s}_{\gamma \gamma}= 500$ GeV and $M_H \sim 100$ GeV, they are at the
level of 0.1 fb.  

\subsubsection*{\underline{Higgs production in $e\gamma$ collisions}}

Finally, let us close this discussion on Higgs physics at the photonic 
mode of future $\ee$ linear colliders by considering the other possible
option, the $e \gamma$ mode, that can be obtained by converting only one of
the electron beams into a very energetic back--scattered photon.  Higgs bosons
can be produced in $e\gamma$ collisions through bremsstrahlung off the $W$
lines,  $e^- \gamma \to \nu_e W^- H$ \cite{egam-H,egam-Hall}; the relevant 
diagrams are shown in Fig. 4.46. \s

\vspace*{1cm}

For a low mass Higgs boson, $M_H \sim 100$ GeV, the cross section for the
subprocess [again without folding with the photon spectrum] is at the level of
$\sim 40$ fb for $\sqrt{s}_{e\gamma}=500$ GeV and increases monotonically to
reach values of the order of 100 (300) fb for $\sqrt{s}_{e \gamma}= 1\, (2)$
TeV; i.e. the rates are comparable to those of the $WW$ fusion in $\ee$
collisions at high energies. While the variation of the cross section with the
Higgs mass is rather pronounced at low energies [$\sigma (e\gamma \to
\nu_e WH)$ drops by a factor of two when increasing $M_H$ from 100 to 150 GeV,
as a result of phase space reduction], it is very mild at higher energies. When
convoluting the cross sections  with the back--scattered photon flux, they are
reduced by about $50$\%  at $\sqrt{s_{e\gamma}}=500$ GeV and slightly less at
higher energies \cite{egam-Hall}.\s

The large Higgs production rates in this process could allow to perform
an independent determination of the $HWW$ couplings [which can be made already
in the  $\ee \to H \nu \bar{\nu}$ production and $H \to WW$ decay process if
the Higgs is not too heavy] and to probe anomalous contributions.
However, the environment of the collision should be well under control to match
the accuracy which can be achieved in the clean $\ee$  mode of the linear
collider. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Higgs production at muon colliders}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The ability of a future $\mu^+ \mu^-$ collider to investigate the Higgs sector
of the SM and its  extensions has been discussed in numerous papers; see for
instance the detailed reviews of
Refs.~\cite{mu-machine1,mu-machine2,mu-Rev1,mu-Rev2,mu-Rev3,mu-Rev4}.  In this
section, we simply summarize the main studies which have been performed
in this context, concentrating on the benefits of such a collider compared to
$\ee$ linear colliders for determining the properties of the Higgs particle.  

\subsubsection{Higgs production in the $s$--channel}

\subsubsection*{\underline{Resonant Higgs production at the tree--level}} 

In $\mu^+ \mu^-$ collisions, the resonance production cross section for a Higgs
boson decaying into a final state X is given, in terms of the partial decay 
widths, by
\beq
\sigma_H (\sqrt{s})= \frac{ 4\pi \Gamma(H \to \mu^+ \mu^-) \Gamma (H \to X)}
{(s-M_H^2)^2 + M_H^2 \Gamma_H^2}
\eeq
In practice, however, on has to include the Gaussian center of mass energy
spread $\sigma_{\sqrt{s}}$. Assuming a central c.m. energy value $\sqrt{s}$,
one obtains after convolution \cite{mu-schannel}
\beq
\overline{\sigma}_H (\sqrt{s}) = \frac{1}{2\pi \sigma_{\sqrt{s}}} \int \sigma_H (\sqrt{
\hat{s} }) \ {\rm exp} \left(  \frac{ - \left( \sqrt{\hat{s}} - \sqrt{s}
\right)^2 } {2 \sigma^2_{\sqrt{s}} } \right) \, {\rm d} \sqrt{\hat{s}}
\eeq
which, when the energy is tuned to the Higgs boson mass value, gives
\begin{equation}
\overline{\sigma}_H(\sqrt{s} \simeq M_H) = \frac{4\pi}{M^{2}_{H}}\frac{{\rm BR}  (H
\rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-) {\rm BR} (H \rightarrow X)} {\Bigl[ 1+ \frac{8}  {\pi}
\Bigl(\sigma_{\sqrt{s}}/ \Gamma_H \Bigr)^2\Bigr]^{1/2}}					 \end{equation}
If the energy spread is much smaller than the Higgs boson total decay width,
the effective cross section is simply given
by %$\overline{\sigma}_H  =\sigma_H (\sqrt{s}=M_H)$
\beq
\sigma_{\sqrt{ s}} \ll \Gamma_H \ : \quad 
\overline{\sigma}_H \simeq \frac{4\pi}{M_H^2} \, {\rm BR}(H \to \mu^+\mu^-)
{\rm BR}(H \to X)
\label{mu-gamma-small}
\eeq
while in the opposite case, the effective cross section reads
\beq
\sigma_{\sqrt{ s}} \gg \Gamma_H \ : \quad 
\overline{\sigma}_H \simeq \frac{4 \pi^2}{M_H^2}  \Gamma (H \to \mu^+ \mu^-)
{\rm BR} (H \to X) \times \frac{1} {2 \sqrt{2\pi} \sigma_{\sqrt{s}} } 
%\left( 1 + \frac{\pi}{8} \frac{ \Gamma_H^2}{ \sigma_{\sqrt{s}}} \right)^{-1/2} 
\label{mumuxsection2}
\eeq
One needs therefore a very small resolution to maximize the Higgs boson 
production rate. \s

Recalling that there is a trade between the luminosity delivered by the machine
and the energy resolution $R$ of the muon beams, \S4.1.3, the production rate  
can be maximized by choosing $R$ such that the energy spread $\sigma_{\sqrt{s}}$
is slightly  smaller than the Higgs boson total decay width, $\sigma_{\sqrt{s}}
\lsim \Gamma_H$, which in the SM corresponds to $R=0.003$\% for $M_H \lsim 120$
GeV. The energy spread can  be then more conveniently written as \cite{mu-Rev1}
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\sqrt{s}} = 0.002 \, {\rm GeV} \, \Bigl( \, \frac{R}{0.003\%}\Bigr) \, 
\Bigl(\frac{\sqrt{s}}{100 \, \rm {GeV} }\Bigr)
\end{equation}
For Higgs bosons in the low mass range, $M_H \lsim 130$ GeV, a small resolution
$R=0.003$\% would be more advantageous.  In the intermediate Higgs
mass range, 130 GeV $\lsim M_H \lsim$ 160 GeV,  the Higgs boson is broad enough
and  one can use a resolution $R = 0.01$\% without too much loss of production
rates. In such a case, the cross sections are functions of the Higgs branching
fractions and Higgs masses and practically do not depend on $R$; this is even 
more true for Higgs bosons in the  high mass range, $M_H \gsim 180$ GeV.

\subsubsection*{\underline{$\mu^+ \mu^- \to b\bar b$ and the radiative 
corrections}} 

For a light Higgs boson, $M_H \lsim 140$ GeV, the dominant decay  is $H \to b
\bar b$ and one has to consider the full process $\mu^+ \mu^- \to b\bar b$
which receives contributions from the resonant $\mu^+ \mu^- \to H \to b\bar b$
channel and continuum $\mu^+ \mu^- \to \gamma, Z \to b\bar b$ production;
Fig.~4.47a.  The latter is mediated by gauge boson $s$--channel exchange and
would act as a background.

The photonic corrections which include the gauge invariant subset of initial 
and final state virtual corrections and box diagrams involving at least one 
photon as well a initial and final state photon radiation, Fig.~4.47b, and
the QCD corrections to the final state with virtual gluon exchange and 
gluon emission, Fig.~4.47c, have been calculated in Ref.~\cite{mu-RC} with
a careful treatment of both the $Z$ and Higgs boson resonances.  In the case
where no energy resolution is included, the results are shown in Fig.~4.48
for the production of SM Higgs bosons with masses $M_H=115$ GeV and 150 GeV. 
The tree--level couplings have been expressed in terms of $G_\mu$ to encapsulate
the leading electroweak correction and the running $b$--quark mass has been 
used in the $Hb\bar b$ coupling to absorb the bulk of the QCD corrections.\s

For the photonic corrections, the large ISR corrections from the radiative
return to the $Z$ resonance can be suppressed by requiring that the invariant
mass of the hadronic final state, thus including gluon radiation, should not
exceed 10 GeV  compared to the Higgs mass, $M_{\rm had} > \sqrt{s} -10$ GeV. 
[For  continuum production, the main difference between $\ee$ and $\mu^+
\mu^-$ collisions is due to the different leading logarithmic photonic
corrections, $\log (s/m_\ell^2)$, which lead to ISR effects that are roughly a
factor of two smaller in $\mu^+ \mu^-$ than in $\ee$ collisions.] With this cut,
the photonic corrections which are still dominated by ${\cal O}(\alpha)$ ISR 
turn negative and of order $- 5\, (10)\%$ for $M_H=115\, (150)$ GeV
for the continuum production and $\sim -50\%$ for the resonant production,
leading to a reduction of the resonance peak compared to the continuum
background.  The QCD corrections are positive and, as they are larger for the
Higgs mediated channel $[\sim 20\%$ as discussed in \S2.1.2] compared to $b\bar
b$ continuum production [$\sim \frac{\alpha_s}{\pi} \sim 4\%$], they tend to
enhance the resonance peak. \s

When including a beam energy resolution $R=0.003\%$, the relative impact of the 
radiative correction stays the same. However, the  signal peaks are suppressed,
in particular for small Higgs masses. For instance, the ratio is $\sigma_{
\sqrt{s}}/\Gamma_H \sim 0.7$ at $M_H=115$ GeV, compared to $\sigma_{\sqrt{s}}/
\Gamma_H \sim 0.2$ at $M_H=150$ GeV, as can be seen in Fig.~4.49.

\subsubsection*{\underline{Signals and backgrounds in $\mu^+ \mu^- \to
H \to b\bar b, WW, ZZ$}} 

In the main Higgs decay channels, $H \to b\bar b, WW, ZZ$, the cross sections 
for the signals and the corresponding SM backgrounds are shown in the left--hand
side of Fig.~4.50 as a function of the Higgs mass in the range $M_H=80$--160 
GeV for an energy resolution $R=0.003\%$. In the right--hand side of the 
figure, the luminosity that is required to observe the signal at the 5$\sigma$ 
level is displayed for the same energy resolution. Various cuts have been 
applied to reject part of the background [$b$--tagging, cuts to remove gauge
bosons in the forward and backward directions] and are discussed in 
Ref.~\cite{mu-Rev1} from which we borrowed the figure. \s

As can be seen, the $\mu^+ \mu^- \to H \to b\bar{b}$ signal rate is rather 
large for $M_H \lsim 140$ GeV, leading to ${\cal O}(10^4)$ events for a 
luminosity of ${\cal L}=1~{\rm fb}^{-1}$. The backgrounds from direct $\mu^+ 
\mu^- \to \gamma, Z^* \to b\bar{b}$ production\footnote{Since  the background is
practically constant in the window  $M_H \pm \sigma_{\sqrt{s}}$, one can
measure it below and above the resonance and eventually, subtract it if enough
luminosity is available} [the light quark--jet background can be removed with
$b$--tagging] is much larger than the signal for a Higgs boson in the mass
range $M_H \lsim 115$ GeV which is ruled out by the LEP2 negative searches [in
particular, for $M_H \sim 90$ GeV a huge background from the resonant
production $\mu^+ \mu^-  \to Z \to b\bar{b}$ is present], and is of comparable
size as the signal in the mass range 115 GeV $\lsim M_H \lsim$ 135 GeV. For 
larger masses, the signal  event drop dramatically because of the decrease of 
the $H \to b\bar{b}$  branching ratio. \s

In the case of gauge boson production, $\mu^+ \mu^- \to WW^*$ and $ZZ^*$, the 
event rates are much smaller than those of the $b\bar{b}$ final
states in the low Higgs mass range, as a result of the tiny branching ratios. 
For larger masses, $M_H \sim 140$ GeV, the $WW$ and $b\bar b$ cross sections
become comparable but the absolute rates are rather small;  for $M_H \gsim 160$
GeV, the cross sections are below the femtobarn level. The backgrounds from
continuum $\mu^+ \mu^- \to WW^*, ZZ^*$ production [once cuts have been applied
to remove for instance the forward and backward events which are rare in the
signal where the Higgs boson is centrally produced] do not exceed the signal
cross sections for $M_H \lsim 150$ GeV.  For higher Higgs masses, $M_H \gsim
160$ GeV, when the production of two real gauge bosons opens up kinematically,
the backgrounds become much larger than the resonant signal. \s

For a SM Higgs boson with a mass $M_H\gsim 2M_W$, $s$--channel production
in $\mu^+ \mu^-$ colliders will, anyway, not be very useful since the total
width becomes large and the $H \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay branching fraction
drops drastically.  However, there are extensions of the SM in which Higgs
bosons can have relatively large masses but suppressed total  widths [this is 
the case of e.g. pseudoscalar Higgs bosons which do not couple to 
massive gauge bosons at tree--level]. In this case, the production rates 
are not very suppressed and muon colliders can be valuable tools in 
determining their properties as will be discussed in another part of this 
review.  

\subsubsection{Determination of the properties of a light Higgs boson}

In the SM, for Higgs bosons in the mass range $M_H \lsim 160$ GeV, important
measurements can be  performed at the muon collider in the  channels $\mu^+
\mu^- \to H \to  b\bar{b}, WW^*,ZZ^*$,  which  have sizable production rates as
shown previously, as well as in the channel $\mu^+ \mu^- \to H \to \tau^+
\tau^-$.   The Higgs mass, its total decay width and the cross section
for the various final states, which are sensitive to the branching fractions 
and thus the Higgs couplings, can be determined.\s

The Higgs mass can be measured by a straightforward scan in the vicinity
of $\sqrt{s}= M_H$.  The approximate values of $M_H$  would be already known
from measurements at $\ee$ and hadron colliders, or being measured at the muon
collider by producing  first the Higgs boson in the Higgs--strahlung channel,
$\mu^+ \mu^- \to HZ$.  The detection of the signal peak for a Higgs mass
$M_H=110$ GeV has been performed e.g. in Ref.~\cite{mu-Murray} and the output
is summarized in Fig.~4.51 which has been obtained with 10 pb$^{-1}$ data,
assuming that the beam energy spread is very small.  The Monte Carlo generator
{\tt PYTHIA} has been used to generate the $\mu^+\mu^- \to H \to b\bar b$ signal
and the $\mu^+ \mu^- \to q\bar q (\gamma)$ background events and a crude
estimate of detector effects [using a typical LEP detector] has been made. It
has been assumed that 80\% efficiency for $b$--quark tagging can be achieved
as expected at the LC for instance.  For such a Higgs mass, one is close the
$Z$ boson resonance and the backgrounds are rather large; they become smaller
when one moves to higher Higgs masses, but the Higgs branching ratio BR$(H\to 
b\bar b)$ becomes then smaller. In another analysis presented in
Ref.~\cite{mu-precision} but which takes into account the energy spread, it has
been shown that a precision of the order of $\Delta M_H \sim 0.1$ MeV for $M_H 
\simeq 115$ GeV can be achieved with $\sim 30$ data points with a luminosity 
${\cal L}=1.25~{\rm pb}^{-1}$ per point and a resolution $R=0.003$\%.\s

account; from Ref.~\cite{mu-Murray}.} 
\vspace*{-2mm}
\end{figure}


Since both the Higgs mass $M_H$ and its total width $\Gamma_H$ enter the cross
section value at the same time, and if one refrains from making any theoretical
assumption on the  partial decay widths, a model--independent determination of
$\Gamma_H$ is required. This determination can be made
\cite{mu-Rev1,mulineshape} by noting that if one adjusts the normalization of
the theoretical curve of $\Gamma_H$ at $\sqrt{s}=M_H$ in such a way that it
agrees with the experimental curve, then the wings of the theoretical curve are
increased (decreased) if $\Gamma_H$ is larger (smaller).  With precise
measurements at a central energy value $\sqrt{s}$ and at the wings, one can
measure $\Gamma_H$ through the ratio of the cross sections at the central peak
and on the wings, in which the partial decay widths cancel out. This method,
with a dedicated three point scan near the threshold, allows to measure $M_H$
at the same time with a precision that is expected to be better than the 
rough scan discussed above, with the same integrated luminosity.\s

However, for a light Higgs boson which might be very narrow, one could achieve
a very small beam energy resolution, $\sigma_{\sqrt{s}} \ll \Gamma_H$, only at
a cost of a low luminosity. In this case, it has been advocated to operate
the collider  at the Higgs peak with two different resolutions, $\sigma_{\sqrt{
s}}^{\rm min} \ll \Gamma_H$ and $\sigma^{\rm max}_{ \sqrt{s}} \gg \Gamma_H$ 
and determine the total width from the ratios of the peak cross sections
\cite{mulineshape}. Using eqs.~(\ref{mu-gamma-small})--(\ref{mumuxsection2}), 
one obtains
\beq
\overline{\sigma}_H (\sigma_{\sqrt{s}}^{\rm min}) /
\overline{\sigma}_H (\sigma_{\sqrt{s}}^{\rm max}) = [2\sqrt 2 \sigma_{\sqrt{
s}}^{\rm min}]/[\sqrt \pi \Gamma_H]
\eeq
Figure 4.52a, shows the results of a Monte-Carlo simulation \cite{mu-Rev4}
for the determination of the total
decay width of the Higgs boson as a function of its mass in the range between
100 and 160 GeV. Also shown in the figure are the spread in the c.m. energy for
a resolution of $R = 0.003\%$ (solid circles) and the spread that is obtained
if the resolution $R$ is varied in such a way that the beam energy spread is
always 40\% of the Higgs total decay width (open squares). Here, one assumes
that any value of the resolution $R$ can be obtained and that the luminosity
scales as $R^{2/3}$;  this procedure helps to optimize the Higgs production
rate and, hence, the statistical error on the production cross section.\s

Figure 4.52b displays the factor which reduces the peak cross section when the 
Gaussian distribution with a width $\sigma_{\sqrt s}$ is included. This 
signal reduction factor is given by
\beq
S_R = \eta \, A e^{A^2} \left( \sqrt \pi - 2 \int_0^A \, e^{-t^2} {\rm d}t
\right) \ , \quad A=   \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\, \frac{\Gamma_H}{\sigma_{\sqrt s} }
\eeq
where $\eta$ is factor which takes into account the effects of ISR. With a 
fixed resolution, $R = 0.003\%$ (filled circles), the signal cross section is 
reduced by approximately a factor of two for low Higgs masses, $M_H \lsim 130$ 
GeV, while for masses close to $M_H \sim 160$ GeV, the Higgs total width 
becomes large enough and there is no reduction.  For an optimally varying $R$ 
value (open squares), the peak cross section is reduced by a constant factor 
$S_R \simeq 0.8$.\s

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The peak cross sections for the processes $\mu^+ \mu^- \to b\bar b$ and $\mu^+
\mu^- \to WW^{(*)}$ are shown in Fig.~4.52c as a function of $M_H$ under the
same conditions  as above with an integrated luminosity of ${\cal L}=100$ pb$^{
-1}$. While the simulation of $b\bar b$ decays is as described previously, the
efficiency in the channel $H\to WW^*$ is based on a LEP2--type detector with the
conservative assumption that the spin information is not used to further reduce
the non--resonant $WW$ background.  As can be seen, the $b\bar b$ cross section
can be measured with a statistical accuracy of about 10\%, while a 20\%
accuracy can be achieved on the $WW^*$ cross section for $M_H=130$--150 GeV.
The accuracy will improve by a factor of two if the luminosity is increased to
${\cal L}=400$ pb$^{-1}$, which corresponds to four years of running, thereby
approaching those which can be achieved at the LC. The accuracy on the 
production cross section for the $ZZ$ final state is expected to be worse as 
BR$(H\to ZZ^*)$ is very small in this mass range. \s  

Once the Higgs mass, total decay width and peak cross sections have been
determined, one can measure the partial decay width  into muons $\Gamma
(H\to \mu^+ \mu^-)$ and the final state branching ratios BR$(H \to X)$.  From
the cross section eq.~(\ref{mumuxsection2}), they appear
as the product
\beq
B(X) = \Gamma(H \to \mu^+ \mu^-) \times {\rm BR}(H \to X)
\eeq
These measurements can be then combined with other precision measurements
performed at the LHC and/or at $\ee$ colliders to determine the couplings of
the Higgs boson in a model independent way. For instance, the Higgs partial
decay width into muons, if the measurements at the linear collider 
discussed in the previous section  are available, can be determined through
\cite{mu-Rev2}
\beq
\Gamma (H \to \mu^+ \mu^-) &=& \frac{B(X)} { {\rm BR}(H \to X)_{\rm LC} }
\eeq
with $b\bar{b}$ and $WW^*$ final states for instance, where the branching
ratios in the denominator can be measured precisely at the LC in the low Higgs
mass range,  or make use of the total decay width measured at muon colliders,
via
\beq
\Gamma (H \to \mu^+ \mu^-) &=& \frac{B(X) \times \Gamma_H }{\Gamma(H \to 
X)|_{\rm LC}}
\eeq
for the $WW^*$ and eventually $ZZ^*$ final states where the partial widths can 
be measured at the LC for large enough Higgs boson masses. The combination of 
all measurements allow a very precise test of the Higgs couplings to fermions 
and gauge bosons and, in particular, a precise determination of the Higgs 
couplings to second generation fermions. 

\subsubsection{Study of the CP properties of the Higgs boson}

\subsubsection*{\underline{Measurements in the decay $H \to \tau^+ \tau^-$}}

A very interesting process to study at muon colliders is $\mu^+ \mu^- \to
\tau^+ \tau^-$ \cite{mu-Htau,mu-Htau0}. The process proceeds
through $s$--channel photon and $Z$ boson exchanges as well as via $s$--channel
Higgs boson exchange. In the former channels, the production is similar to what
occurs in $\ee$ collisions and,  as discussed in \S1.2, the process has
characteristic forward--backward and left--right asymmetries. Assuming that the
$\mu^\pm$ beams have longitudinal  polarizations $P_\pm$ and  using
eqs.~(\ref{eexsection},\ref{eeafb},\ref{eealr}) for the cross
section and asymmetries,  one can write the differential cross section for
$\mu^+ \mu^- \to \gamma, Z^* \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ as
\beq
\frac{ {\rm d}\sigma_{\gamma,Z}}{ {\rm d} \cos \theta}=\frac{4\pi \alpha^2}{3s}
 \times \frac{3}{8} \sigma_U \left[ (1+ \cos^2 \theta) + \frac{8}{3} \cos 
\theta A_{FB}^{\rm eff}  \right]
\eeq
where $A_{FB}^{\rm eff}$ has the usual component $A_{FB}^\tau$ already 
discussed, but also a component which includes the information on the
longitudinal polarization and $A_{LR,FB}^\tau$ in eq.~(\ref{eealr})
\beq
A_{FB}^{\rm eff} = \frac{ A_{FB}^{\tau} + P_{\rm eff} A^\tau_{LR,FB} }
{1+ P_{\rm eff} A_{LR}^\tau } \ \ , \  P_{\rm eff}= \frac{P_+ - P_-}
{1- P_+ P_-}
\eeq
The angular distribution has a clear forward--backward asymmetry: it vanishes
for $\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}$ and is large and positive for $\theta=0$. For 
$\sqrt{s}=120$ GeV one has  $A_{FB} \sim 0.7$ and $A_{LR}=0.15$
\cite{mu-Htau}. \s

In the Higgs boson exchange channel, the differential cross section is
flat and is simply given, in terms of the effective cross section with
$\sqrt{s}=M_H$,  by
\beq
\frac{ {\rm d} \sigma}{ {\rm d} \cos \theta} = \frac{1}{2} \overline{\sigma}_H
\left (1 + P_+ P_- \right)
\eeq
Considering this channel as the signal and the $\gamma,Z$ exchange channel
as the background, the enhancement of the signal cross section compared to
the background is given by
\beq
\frac{S}{B} \sim \frac{1+ P_+ P_-}{ 1-P_+ P_- +(P_+ - P_-) A_{LR}^\tau}
\eeq
One can therefore use the polarization of the initial beams and the
forward--backward asymmetries to enhance the signal--to--background ratio. \s

One can also distinguish the signal from the background by using the final
state polarization of the $\tau$ leptons which are very different. We will
briefly discuss this point, following Ref.~\cite{mu-Htau} and recalling
the discussion of \S2.1.4 on $H \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ decays. In the two--body
decays of the $\tau$ lepton,  $\tau^- \to \pi^- \nu_\tau, \rho^- \nu_\tau,\ 
etc..$, defining  $\theta_i$ as the angle between the momenta of the $\tau$
lepton and the charged final  particle, $B$ as the branching ratio of the decay
and $P_\tau = \pm 1$ as the $\tau$ lepton helicity, the normalized differential 
decay rate in the $\tau$ rest frame is simply 
\beq
\frac{1}{\Gamma} \frac{ {\rm d}\Gamma_{i} }{ {\rm d}c_{\theta_i}} =
\frac{B_i}{2} (1+ r_i P_{\tau} \cos  \theta_i )
\eeq
with $r_i=1$ for decays into pions and $r_i= -(m_\tau^2 -2m_i^2)/
(m_\tau^2+ 2 m_i^2) \simeq 0.45$ for $i=\rho$. In the signal, $\mu^+ \mu^- \to 
H \to \tau^+ \tau^-$, the $\tau^-$ and $\tau^+$ helicities are correlated as 
$P_{\tau^-}\!=\!P_{\tau^+}\!=\!\pm 1$, and the spin correlated  differential 
cross section with polarized $P_\pm$ beams reads
\beq
\frac{ {\rm d}\sigma_H} { {\rm d}c_{\theta_i} {\rm d}c_{\theta_j} }
= (1+ P_- P_+) \, \sigma_H \, \frac{B_i B_j}{4} \, \left[ a_i a_j + b_i b_j
c_{\theta_i} c_{\theta_j} \right]
\eeq
reaching a maximum (minimum) for 
$c_{\theta_i}\!=\!c_{\theta_j}(c_{\theta_i}\!=-c_{\theta_j})\!=\pm \!1$, with 
the significance of the peaks depending on the  magnitude of $r_i$. In the case
of the decay  $\tau^-\to \rho^- \nu_\tau$, distinctive peaks in the distribution
can be seen  for $c_{\theta_{\rho^-}}$=$c_{\theta_{\rho^+}}=\pm 1$ and
$P_+=P_-=25$\%  \cite{mu-Htau}. \s

In contrast, in the standard channel $\mu^+ \mu^- \to \gamma, Z^* \to \tau^+
\tau^-$, the $\tau$ leptons are produced with helicities $P_{\tau^-} = -
P_{\tau^+} = \pm1$ and the number of left--handed and right--handed
$\tau$ leptons  are different because of the polarization left--right asymmetry.
The spin correlated  differential distribution in this case is 
 \beq
\frac{ {\rm d}\sigma_{\gamma,Z}} { {\rm d}c_{\theta_i} {\rm d}c_{\theta_j}}
&=& (1- P_- P_+) \sigma_{\gamma,Z} \, (1+ P_{\rm eff} A_{LR} ) \, \non \\
&\times & \frac{1}{4} B_i B_j \left[ (a_i a_j - b_i b_j c_{\theta_i} 
c_{\theta_j})+ (a_i b_j c_{\theta_j} - a_j b_i  c_{\theta_i}  )A_{LR}^{\rm eff} \right]
\label{mumucore-bckg}
\eeq
with
\beq
A_{LR}^{\rm eff}= \frac{A_{FB,LR}^\tau+ P_{\rm eff} A_{FB}^\tau }{1+ P_{\rm 
eff} A_{LR}^\tau } 
\eeq
Again, for the decay  $\tau^- \to \rho^- \nu_\tau$, the peaks in the
distribution  for $\cos  \theta_{\rho^-} = - \cos \theta_{\rho^+} = \pm 1$ can
be seen for  $P_+=P_-=25$\% \cite{mu-Htau}. The peaks occur in opposite
regions compared to the Higgs signal and the spin correlation in the signal is
symmetric, while it is not the case in the background as  a consequence
of the presence of the term $A_{LR}^{\rm eff}$ in eq.~(\ref{mumucore-bckg}). \s

Summing both $\rho\nu$ and $\tau \nu$ final states and using $R=0.0005$\%, 
$P_\pm=25$\% and ${\cal L}=1~{\rm fb}^{-1}$, one obtains the statistical
error $\epsilon\!=\!\sqrt{S+B}/S$ on the cross section measurement which
determines to which extent the $H \tau^+ \tau^-$ coupling can be measured. For
$M_H\!=\!110\, (130)$ GeV, one has $\epsilon \simeq 20$\% (30\%) showing that 
one can observe the resonant $\mu^+ \mu^- \to H \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ process 
above the continuum background and therefore possibly  measure the $H \tau^+ 
\tau^-$ coupling and check the Higgs boson spin. \s

Note that because of depolarization effects, this type  of analysis cannot be
performed in the decays $H\to b\bar b$, while for $H \to t\bar t$ the rates are
too small, the Higgs resonance being very broad as discussed earlier. On the
other hand, the CP quantum numbers of a relatively heavier Higgs boson, $M_H
\gsim 140$ GeV, can be studied in the decays $H\to VV^* \to 4f$ by looking at
angular distributions and correlations as discussed  in detail in \S2.2.4.  
 
\subsubsection*{\underline{CP Measurements with transverse polarization}}

It is expected that muon colliders will have a natural transverse polarization
of the order of 20\% for both the $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ beams. This polarization,
if maximized, could also provide an unambiguous test of the CP quantum numbers
of the Higgs boson \cite{CP-GunionGrz,CP-Gunion-GP,mu-pol}, similarly to the
case of $\gamma \gamma$  colliders previously discussed. Indeed, if one
considers a scalar particle with couplings to muons which have both CP--even
and CP--odd components, ${\cal L}(H \mu\mu) \propto H \bar{\mu} (a + i
b\gamma_5)\mu$, and assumes that the muon beams are 100\% transversally
polarized, with $\phi$ being the angle between the $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$
transverse polarizations, the production cross section of the Higgs boson in
the $s$--channel reads 
\beq
\sigma(\mu^+ \mu^- \to H) \propto 1 - \frac{ a^2- b^2}{a^2+b^2} 
\cos \phi + \frac{2 a b}{ a^2 + b^2} \sin \phi
\eeq
If the Higgs boson is a mixture of CP--even and CP--odd states, both the
$a_+$ and $a_-$ components are non--zero and the asymmetry 
\beq
{\cal A}_1 = \frac{ \sigma( \phi= \frac{\pi}{2})-\sigma( \phi=- \frac{\pi}{2})}
{\sigma( \phi=\frac{\pi}{2})+\sigma( \phi=-\frac{\pi}{2})}=\frac{ 2 a b}
{a^2 + b^2} 
\eeq
is large if $a$ and $b$ have the same magnitude. A non--zero value of this
asymmetry would indicate a clear violation of CP symmetry. For a pure 
CP--eigenstate, one of the coefficients $a$ or $b$ is zero and the 
asymmetry
\beq
{\cal A}_2 = \frac{ \sigma( \phi= \pi) - \sigma( \phi=0)}
{ \sigma( \phi= \pi) + \sigma( \phi=0)} = \frac{a^2 - b^2}
{a^2 + b^2} 
\eeq
is either equal to $+1$ or $-1$, if the Higgs boson is, respectively a CP--even
or a CP--odd state. In the ideal world, this is an unambiguous  test of the CP
nature of the Higgs boson. However, the transverse polarization will most 
probably not be maximal
and background events will alter the signal and dilute the asymmetries. 
Thorough studies, including the machine and background aspects must be
performed to quantify the extent to which the Higgs boson CP--properties can be
measured; see  Ref.~\cite{CP-Gunion-GP} for such an attempt.
