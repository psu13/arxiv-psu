\@doendnote{endnote9}{It is easy to generalize the present discussion to the case of three or more particles.}
\@doendnote{endnote10}{This box diagram has been studied in different contexts, e.g. in the theory of two photon scattering.}
\@doendnote{endnote11}{The ``Infrared Divergencies" related to the integration over arbitrarily small photons momenta can be handled as shown in Chapter 13 of Ref. \cite {WeinbookI}, and they eventually cancel.}
\@doendnote{endnote12}{An undetermined number of photons can also be created due to the interaction of any observed system with the particles belonging to the measuring apparatus. Although such an effect will not be used in the following discussion, it can be interesting for the Theory of Measurement.}
\@doendnote{endnote13}{In all such cases, additional photons can also be radiated by the lines of all the possible charged particles (besides the EPR pair) that are involved in the relevant ``blob" production process.}
\@doendnote{endnote14}{However, the QFT field equations are deterministic. This is an important point, whose possible consequences for the problem of locality will be discussed elsewhere.}
\@doendnote{endnote15}{Possibly the only observables that can actually get a local reality in QFT are the conserved gauge charges. This would not prevent QFT to fulfill the EPR criterion of reality, that only requires the existence of a counterpart for all the physical reality of the theory.}
