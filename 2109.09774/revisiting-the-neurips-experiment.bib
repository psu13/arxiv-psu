  abstract =	 {Frequently, a set of objects has to be evaluated by
                  a panel of assessors, but not every object is
                  assessed by every assessor. A problem facing such
                  panels is how to take into account different
                  standards among panel members and varying levels of
                  confidence in their scores. Here, a mathematically
                  based algorithm is developed to calibrate the scores
                  of such assessors, addressing both of these
                  issues. The algorithm is based on the connectivity
                  of the graph of assessors and objects evaluated,
                  incorporating declared confidences as weights on its
                  edges. If the graph is sufficiently well connected,
                  relative standards can be inferred by comparing how
                  assessors rate objects they assess in common,
                  weighted by the levels of confidence of each
                  assessment. By removing these biases, ?true? values
                  are inferred for all the objects. Reliability
                  estimates for the resulting values are obtained. The
                  algorithm is tested in two case studies: one by
                  computer simulation and another based on realistic
                  evaluation data. The process is compared to the
                  simple averaging procedure in widespread use, and to
                  Fisher's additive incomplete block analysis. It is
                  anticipated that the algorithm will prove useful in
                  a wide variety of situations such as evaluation of
                  the quality of research submitted to national
                  assessment exercises; appraisal of grant proposals
                  submitted to funding panels; ranking of job
                  applicants; and judgement of performances on degree
                  courses wherein candidates can choose from lists of
                  options.  }
