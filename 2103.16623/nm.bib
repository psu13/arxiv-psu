The positrons are interpreted as arising from a two-step process in which laser photons are backscattered to GeV energies by the electron beam followed by a collision between the high-energy photon and several laser photons to produce an electron-positron pair. These results are the first laboratory evidence for inelastic light-by-light scattering involving only real photons.},

	abstract = {A long-standing prediction of quantum electrodynamics, yet to be experimentally observed, is the interaction between real photons in vacuum. As a consequence of this interaction, the vacuum is expected to become birefringent and dichroic if a strong laser field polarizes its virtual particle–antiparticle dipoles. Here, we derive how a generally polarized probe photon beam is influenced by both vacuum birefringence and dichroism in a strong linearly polarized plane-wave laser field. Furthermore, we consider an experimental scheme to measure these effects in the nonperturbative high-energy regime, where the Euler-Heisenberg approximation breaks down. By employing circularly polarized high-energy probe photons, as opposed to the conventionally considered linearly polarized ones, the feasibility of quantitatively confirming the prediction of nonlinear QED for vacuum birefringence at the 5σ confidence level on the time scale of a few days is demonstrated for upcoming 10 PW laser systems. Finally, dichroism and anomalous dispersion in vacuum are shown to be accessible at these facilities.},

	abstract = {The interplay of quantum anomalies with magnetic field and vorticity results in a variety of novel non-dissipative transport phenomena in systems with chiral fermions, including the quark–gluon plasma. Among them is the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME)—the generation of electric current along an external magnetic field induced by chirality imbalance. Because the chirality imbalance is related to the global topology of gauge fields, the CME current is topologically protected and hence non-dissipative even in the presence of strong interactions. As a result, the CME and related quantum phenomena affect the hydrodynamical and transport behavior of strongly coupled quark–gluon plasma, and can be studied in relativistic heavy ion collisions where strong magnetic fields are created by the colliding ions. Evidence for the CME and related phenomena has been reported by the STAR Collaboration at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at BNL, and by the ALICE Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The goal of the present review is to provide an elementary introduction into the physics of anomalous chiral effects, to describe the current status of experimental studies in heavy ion physics, and to outline the future work, both in experiment and theory, needed to eliminate the existing uncertainties in the interpretation of the data.},

The ratio of the di-electron continuum to the combinatorial background is larger than 10\% over the entire mass range. Simulations of di-electrons from light-meson decays and heavy-flavor decays (charmonium and open charm correlation) are found to describe the data. The extracted \${\textbackslash}omega{\textbackslash}rightarrow e{\textasciicircum}\{+\}e{\textasciicircum}\{-\}\$ invariant yields are consistent with previous measurements. The mid-rapidity yields (\$dN/dy\$) of \${\textbackslash}phi\$ and \$J/{\textbackslash}psi\$ are extracted through their di-electron decay channels and are consistent with the previous measurements of \${\textbackslash}phi{\textbackslash}rightarrow K{\textasciicircum}\{+\}K{\textasciicircum}\{-\}\$ and \$J/{\textbackslash}psi{\textbackslash}rightarrow e{\textasciicircum}\{+\}e{\textasciicircum}\{-\}\$. Our results suggest a new upper limit of the branching ratio of the \${\textbackslash}eta {\textbackslash}rightarrow e{\textasciicircum}\{+\}e{\textasciicircum}\{-\}\$ of \$1.7{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ at 90\% confidence level.},

The excess pairs have transverse momenta pT{\textless}150MeV/c and are most prominent in peripheral gold-gold and uranium-uranium collisions. The pairs exhibit a peak at the J/ψ mass, but include a wide continuum, with pair invariant masses from 400MeV/c2 up to 2.6GeV/c2. The ALICE Collaboration observes a similar excess in peripheral lead-lead collisions, but only at the J/ψ mass, without a corresponding continuum. This paper presents a calculation of the cross section and kinematic for two-photon production of e+e− pairs, and find general agreement with the STAR data. The calculation is based on the starlight simulation code, which is based on the Weizsäcker-Williams virtual photon approach. The STAR continuum observations are compatible with two-photon production of e+e− pairs. The ALICE analysis required individual muon pT be greater than 1 GeV/c; this eliminated almost all of the pairs from two-photon interactions, while leaving most of the J/ψ decays.},

The current LHC detector configurations can explore small \$x\$ hard phenomena with nuclei and nucleons at photon-nucleon center-of-mass energies above 1 TeV, extending the \$x\$ range of HERA by a factor of ten. In particular, it will be possible to probe diffractive and inclusive parton densities in nuclei using several processes. The interaction of small dipoles with protons and nuclei can be investigated in elastic and quasi-elastic \$J/{\textbackslash}psi\$ and \${\textbackslash}Upsilon\$ production as well as in high \$t\$ \${\textbackslash}rho{\textasciicircum}0\$ production accompanied by a rapidity gap. Several of these phenomena provide clean signatures of the onset of the new high gluon density QCD regime. The LHC is in the kinematic range where nonlinear effects are several times larger than at HERA. Two-photon processes in UPCs are also studied. In addition, while UPCs play a role in limiting the maximum beam luminosity, they can also be used a luminosity monitor by measuring mutual electromagnetic dissociation of the beam nuclei. We also review similar studies at HERA and RHIC as well as describe the potential use of the LHC detectors for UPC measurements.},

The first two processes have been treated in quantum mechanics by Bethe, Møller, and Bloch in a very satisfactory way. A provisional estimation of the order of magnitude to be expected in the third process has been given by Heitler. The result obtained was that the cross-section ϕ for the energy loss by radiation for very fast particles (if the primary energy E0 ≫ mc2) is of the order ϕ ∽ Z2/137 (e2/mc2)2, (1) Where Z is the nuclear charge. It is the aim of the present paper to discuss in greater detain the rate of loss of energy by this third process and its dependence on the primary energy; in particular we shall consider the effect of screening. The results obtained for very high energies ({\textgreater} 137 mc2) seem to be in disagreement with experiments made by Anderson (cf. 7).},

The photon flux is high enough that two-photon interactions may be accompanied by additional photonuclear interactions. Except for the shared impact parameter, these interactions are independent. Additional interactions like mutual Coulomb excitation are of experimental interest, because the neutrons from the nuclear dissociation provide a simple, relatively unbiased trigger. We calculate the cross sections, rapidity, mass, and transverse momentum (pT) distributions for exclusive γγ production of mesons and lepton pairs and for γγ reactions accompanied by mutual Coulomb dissociation. The cross sections for γγ interactions accompanied by multiple neutron emission (XnXn) and single-neutron emission (1n1n) are about 1/10 and 1/100 of that for the unaccompanied γγ interactions. We discuss the accuracy with which these cross sections may be calculated. The typical pT of γγ final states is several times smaller than for comparable coherent photonuclear interactions, so pT may be an effective tool for separating the two classes of interactions.},

Photons from the electromagnetic field of one nucleus interact coherently with the other nucleus. Photonuclear cross sections are scaled from \${\textbackslash}gamma p\$ data, and convoluted with the photon spectrum to find the exclusive rates. The cross sections at the RHIC and LHC heavy ion colliders are huge, 10\% of the total hadronic cross section at RHIC, and 50\% at LHC. These accelerators may be useful as vector meson factories. With iodine beams at RHIC, 640 \${\textbackslash}rho\$ are produced each second (10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}/year); with calcium at the LHC the rate is 240 kHz. The \${\textbackslash}phi\$ rates are 39 Hz at RHIC and 15 kHz at LHC, while the \$J/{\textbackslash}psi\$ rate is 0.3 Hz at RHIC and 780 Hz at the LHC.

For photons the relevant processes are the Breit-Wheeler process as well as the double pair production process. For protons the relevant reactions are the photopion production and the Bethe-Heitler process. We discuss the interplay between the energy loss length and mean free path for the Bethe-Heitler process. Neutrino opacity is determined by its scattering off the cosmic background neutrino.

	abstract = {The influence of retardation on the energy of interaction between two neutral atoms is investigated by means of quantum electrodynamics. As a preliminary step, Part I contains a discussion of the interaction between a neutral atom and a perfectly conducting plane, and it is found that the influence of retardation leads to a reduction of the interaction energy by a correction factor which decreases monotonically with increasing distance R. This factor is equal to unity for R small compared with the wave-lengths corresponding to the atomic frequencies, and is proportional to R−1 for distances large compared with these wave-lengths. In the latter case the total interaction energy is given by −3ℏcα8πR4, where α is the static polarizability of the atom. Although the problem of the interaction of two atoms discussed in Part II is much more difficult to handle mathematically, the results are very similar. Again the influence of retardation can be described by a monotonically decreasing correction factor which is equal to unity for small distances and proportional to R−1 for large distances. In the latter case the energy of interaction is found to be −23ℏcα1α24πR7.},

We give the precise relationship of the process e+e→e+e+X (X isany C=+ state) to the corresponding two-photon annihilation process γ+γ→X, as well as a careful derivation of the equivalent-photon approximation. In the case of the π0 production, we have found that, for the beam energy E in the 1-3 GeV range, the exact total cross section is 20-30\% larger than the one calculated previously in the equivalent-photon approximation. However, the introduction of form factors cuts down the exact total cross section, reducing it to within 10\% of the equivalent-photon-approximation result. For η production the agreement is even better. Thus it appears that the use of the equivalent-photon approximation is justified in most cases. We discuss detailed angular distributions in this approximation for the case of π+π− production. One important problem which cannot be adequately studied in the equivalent-photon approximation is the degree of noncoplanarity of the π+π− (and the μ+μ−) pair. We have studied this problem using the exact formula and found that, for E=1 GeV, typically 40-50\% of pion pairs will be produced with the noncoplanarity angle greater than 12°. We discuss the general structure of the γ+γ→π++π− amplitude as well as a simple model incorporating the σ meson. We also give a rough estimate of multihadron production cross sections.},

The system consists of two separate detector subsystems, one called the Pseudo Vertex Position Detector (pVPD, the “start” detector) and the other called the Time of Flight Patch (TOFp, the “stop” detector). Each detector is based on conventional scintillator/phototube technology and includes custom high-performance front-end electronics and a common CAMAC-based digitization and read-out. The design of the system and its performance during the 2001 RHIC run will be described. The start resolution attained by the pVPD was 24ps, implying a pVPD single-detector resolution of 58ps. The total time resolution of the system averaged over all detector channels was 87ps, allowing direct π/K/p discrimination for momenta up to ∼1.8GeV/c, and direct (π+K)/p discrimination up to ∼3GeV/c.},

We estimate the initial photons' transverse momentum contributions by employing models where the average transverse momentum squared of the incoming photon can be calculated in the equivalent photon approximation.

For peripheral and central collisions, additional \$p\_T\$-broadening effects from multiple interaction with the medium and the magnetic field contributions from the quark-gluon plasma are also discussed.},
