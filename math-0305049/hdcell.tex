% 
% This is one of the files in the new, modular, hdpics system.
% Created on 19/9/2001.
%
% Files:
% hdpics.tex		Just the kernel.  Always necessary.
% hdglob.tex		Globular pics, large and small
% hdglobrare.tex	Less commonly used globular pics, including
% 			the ones with multiply-shafted arrows
% hdcell.tex		Cellular pics
% hdcellrare.tex	Less commonly used globular pics, including
% 			the ones with multiply-shafted arrows
% hdope.tex		Pics of opetopes
% hdtrans.tex		Transistors
